  Abstract                 = {{Traditional IP networks are becoming more complex to satisfy the demands
 of modern applications and it draws communication providers to exploit a
 wide range of specialized hardware. Commissioning of a new network
 service implies additional room for new equipment, power sources,
 cooling systems, etc. Besides, there is need for increase of qualified
 stuff. This results in the escalation of capital and operational
 expenses that eventually exceeds the revenue growth rates for which
 these expenses are initially intended. To overcome such a deadlock, it
 is no more sufficient to introduce new protocols for network
 enhancement, it is necessary to reconsider the network architecture.
 Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a new network paradigm that allows
 managing network services by separating data and control planes. Herein
 network planning and traffic management are performed by software what
 makes installation of new network services, such as routing, resource
 management and security more simple and agile. Interaction between the
 two planes can be provided by means of OpenFlow protocol that allows
 manipulating data plane and collecting various statistics used to form
 global state of a network. In this paper we present an overview of SDN
 and OpenFlow, their key features and main concepts. Next, we present a
 model of SDN-network in the form of a queuing network and propose the
 approach to mean delay time estimation.}},

 to agile due to the high cost of manual regression testing of frequent

 successful for refactoring legacy code that has few (if any) automated
 tests. This report describes two experiences: one with 3 teams applying
 a basic and traditional refactoring approach, and another with 2 teams
 applying the new approach. This new approach helped achieve better
 results in covering code with tests, involved senior management to
 retain their support, and achieved better and more sustainable pace of
 development powered by continuous refactoring techniques.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Cloud Data Centers are becoming a more and more important reality
 nowadays, as more and more services are being offered in the form of
 Cloud resources. In order to accommodate as many requests as possible,
 Data Centers typically deploy oversubscription, which requires a
 thoughtfully calibrated usage of the computing and network resources of
 the system. We especially need to re-think the usage of network
 resources, as the kinds of demands from applications we see today have
 more stringent network requirements than in the past.
 The Software-Defined Network paradigm offers new tools to manage the
 network in agile, flexible ways, according to specific needs. It enables
 to build new customized functions in order, for example, to monitor the
 instantaneous load of traffic, slice the network, route each flow
 according to specific policies that can be modified accordingly with the
 needs of the system.
 In this paper we present an orchestrator for Software-Defined Data
 Center, and the strategies used to allocate Virtual Machines, basing our
 decisions on the current state of the system.}},

 Computing services provisioning. In this challenging scenario, Data
 Centers have to deal with highly dynamic workloads, thus not only should
 they adopt advanced software virtualization solutions, but also network

 be integrated with the computing management infrastructure to make it
 achieve its goals.
 This paper presents an OF-based controller, called OFVN, that enables
 novel virtualization-aware networking functions in Cloud DCs. Virtual
 Machines allocations are performed considering the availability of
 computational resources on physical server, but also selecting a
 forwarding path for VMs data flows based on network links utilization.
 The focus of the paper is on the implementation and assessment of the
 controller in an experimental testbed. The behaviour of different
 allocation strategies is also investigated.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This study aims at developing a simple, yet powerful integrated platform
 for incorporating the various activities of institutions, creating an
 environment that encourages accountability, relevance and retention of
 students' information gathered for universal purposes. Basically, the
 use of application software or automated systems to manage a school is
 synonymous to securing the routine activities of the school, the need to
 automate most of its operations by considering an Online Students'
 Information Management System. This research therefore uses educational
 institutions as a case study.
 The proposed system addresses the problem of manual processes of
 information storage, retrieval and dissemination. This would enable
 academic administrators to load student's information and subsequently
 help academic registry to effectively manage students' data and
 efficiently create various reports. The system can also enable students
 to interact with the system online at the comfort of their homes and
 offices, whilst eliminating the aspect of human errors from lecturers
 manually recording students' grades on sheets of papers (shrink paper
 works).
 The methodology adopted for the study was the Rational Unified Process
 design methodology (RUP), the reason being that it has a hybrid process
 model which brings together various design elements from the generic
 process models that encompasses both user communication and planning
 activities. The developed students' IMS has two separate applications,
 i.e. desktop and web based (online), centralized in one database. The
 former can be used by the school administrators (academic registry) for
 managing and securing student information, the latter can be utilized by
 applicants and continuing students, to apply, register and view their
 results online without any stress. In conclusion, the designed
 custom-made OSIMS software can aid faculty to submit students' results
 to the registry online and in real time, and can enable academic
 institutions to efficiently organize and manage students' information
 effectively.}},

 development to create and deliver good and great software? The answer
 could be in affirmative. And towards this larger end of delivering high
 quality software and ensuring customer satisfaction, promulgated
 explicitly or imbibed implicitly, there has been sustained efforts
 towards creating and adopting new ways, new models and methods of
 software development. As we know, in 2001, some stalwarts and experts in
 various software development methods congregated in Snowbird, Utah to
 sign what is known as the `agile manifesto'. Much water has flown since
 then across the Ganges and the Thames. The present paper is a
 theoretical reflection on the agile development paradigm and in the
 process the paper tries to propose a theoretical foundation to this
 fertile field, taking a system's perspective; including the
 system-of-systems understanding. The theoretical foundation that we
 present in the paper is built on the ideas relating to change as in
 Goldratt's Thinking Processes of the theory of constraints. For
 theoretical evidence, the paper discusses agile development principles
 and practices and then maps the agile principles to the elements of the
 thinking processes. We argue that since agile development is all about
 customer centricity, customer proximity with respect to his needs and
 change requirements, feedback and change in general; the theoretical
 underpinnings for agile development stay hidden in the body of knowledge
 relating to `cybernetics of cybernetics' and the thinking processes of
 the theory of constraints. However, in the present paper, the focus
 remains to find the theoretical foundation to agile development through
 the change challenges and dynamics as expounded by Kotter and the
 thinking processes; as explained in the paper.}},

 since Kanban claimed to offer improved project visibility, software
 quality, team motivation, communication and collaboration. However,
 empirical studies are needed to verify these effects and companies' real
 motivation for the transition. In particular, underlying reasons leading
 software companies to start using Kanban in software maintenance must be
 understood. A multiple-case study was conducted to investigate why two
 experienced Scrum maintenance teams transitioned to Kanban. We conducted
 17 semi-structured interviews with two different teams from two large
 Finnish software companies. Thematic analysis was applied to identify
 the most common challenges in Scrum and their solutions in Kanban. The
 results showed that Scrum maintenance teams faced challenges, such as
 lack of work visibility, task prioritisation, communication and
 collaboration, over commitment of sprints, work synchronisation and
 changing people. We discuss how maintenance teams mitigated these
 challenges with Kanban and present the lessons learned.}},

 its application to software development and other projects. The agile
 movement has brought about significant evolution in the process of
 software development. Its methods have increasingly been adopted
 globally and as a result, they have become one of the main software
 development approaches that are used today. It has provided businesses
 with a much faster and nimbler method for developing software. This is
 especially important for the ever-growing internet software industry and
 the emergent mobile technology. To achieve this goal, this study will
 provide a brief background regarding the development of the movement by
 focusing on its origin and famous agile manifesto. Characterization of
 the agile software processes is essential in explaining how the process
 can be used to shorten the lifecycle of projects. This study will also
 cover various agile methods that have received recognition in project
 and software management. In line with this, arguments have been put
 forth concerning agile projects being more successful than other types
 of projects. This study will clarify this argument. A set of agile
 principles that are likely to be applied to all types of projects will
 also be discussed.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In the last years, prominent advances in software virtualization (e.g.,
 Hypervisor) have enabled the agile deployment of cloud services and, at
 the same time, server consolidation operations through agile Virtual
 Machine (VM) operations (e.g., start-up, snapshot, cloning, and
 migrations) across Data Center (DC) servers. On the other hand, such
 advances pose new challenges in the overall management of the DC
 infrastructure since VM operations may occur much more frequently in
 virtualized than in legacy DCs and produce not only a computational load
 on the involved servers, but also a network load on all the switches
 connecting the servers. In this context, the Software-Defined Network
 (SDN) paradigm opens up new opportunities to design convergent resource
 management systems which is able to address the provisioning of cloud
 services while meeting adequate network performance during VM
 provisioning and migrations.
 In this paper, a promising advanced monitoring and resource allocation
 function for SDN-based DC networks has been proposed aiming at reporting
 possible suitable paths connecting specified servers that can be
 exploited for VM migrations. In such a way, network-assisted migrations
 can be triggered that assure adequate VM migration delays according to
 specified requirements (e.g., minimum delay for live VM migration) while
 addressing different management targets (e.g., network load balancing,
 minimization of energy consumption).}},

 fast evolution of software and software services. Adoption of agile
 software development methodologies has reduced time to market and
 improved success rates; however, deployment obstacles often impede the

 deals with DevOps, a new methodology that extends agile processes to
 include operations. DevOps methodology adopted with cloud computing
 could immediately benefit current practitioners from various software
 development parties while a focus on the young will ensure that DevOps
 ideals and processes will be taken forward into the longer-term future.
 Moving towards clouds, adopting DevOps culture, and implementing DevOps
 tools will produce more innovative services at lower cost and with
 higher quality. Wider adoption of the cloud DevOps will bring cloud
 DevOps features, and the benefit of agile software development,
 automation, and elastic resource provisioning. Additionally, teaching
 cloud DevOps in university will help to overcome the barriers to its
 adoption and maximize its indirect socioeconomic impact.}},

 Frameworks and tools are proposed to support the Dual Application Model

 experts are primarily responsible and designing and implementing the
 software solution to meet the nonfunctional requirements for which the
 software developers are primarily responsible.}},

 engineering approach as exemplified by the waterfall model, where
 specifications have to be fully detailed and agreed upon prior to
 starting the software construction process. Agile software development

 evolve even after the beginning of the development process, among other
 characteristics. Thus, agile methods provide more flexibility than the
 waterfall model, which is a very useful feature in many projects. To
 benefit from the advantages provided by agile methods, the adoption rate
 of these methods in software development projects can be further
 encouraged if certain practices and techniques in agile methods are
 improved. In this paper, an analysis is provided of several practices
 and techniques that are part of agile methods that may hinder their
 broader acceptance. Further, solutions are proposed to improve such

 medium scale projects. As an illustration of the theoretical findings,
 the application of agile methods in managing change in two projects as

  Abstract                 = {{The IT industry is experiencing a disruptive trend for which the entire
 data center infrastructure is becoming software defined and
 programmable. IT resources are provisioned and optimized continuously
 according to a declarative and expressive specification of the workload
 requirements. The software defined environments facilitate agile IT
 deployment and responsive data center configurations that enable rapid
 creation and optimization of value-added services for clients. However,
 this fundamental shift introduces new challenges to existing data center
 management solutions. In this paper, we focus on the storage aspect of
 the IT infrastructure and investigate its unique challenges as well as
 opportunities in the emerging software defined environments. Current
 state-of-the-art software defined storage (SDS) solutions are discussed,
 followed by our novel framework to advance the existing SDS solutions.
 In addition, we study the interactions among SDS, software defined
 compute (SDC), and software defined networking (SDN) to demonstrate the
 necessity of a holistic orchestration and to show that joint
 optimization can significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency
 of the overall software defined environments.}},

 approach in particular has increased over the years. However,
 practitioners, in the software development field, have significant
 challenges in implementing the Kanban approach as it lacks a clear
 definition of its principles, practices, techniques and tools. This
 study aims to provide insight into the Kanban approach and its elements
 (concepts, principles, practices, techniques, and tools) that have been
 empirically reported by scholars and practitioners. This insight is
 produced by using the systematic review method to analyze the available
 literature. A total of 37 primary studies were selected from more than
 3,000 unique studies. Our findings show that the primary studies have
 considered and reported 20 different elements as part of the Kanban
 approach based upon considerations of being an agile approach or a lean
 principle; these elements have realized great benefits and improvements
 to the software development teams. These benefits along with the
 challenges have been reported in this study. Due to the variety of
 organization types, contexts, and project sizes reported in the primary
 studies, it is expected that the results in this study would help in
 establishing knowledge on what are the different elements of the Kanban
 approach as well as offering a first step towards developing guidelines
 for practitioners to help in introducing the Kanban approach to software

 issues in developing mobile cloud applications using agile software
 development methodologies. Sha-Mo-Cloud, a hybrid cloud framework was
 developed leveraging public cloud services for storing data including
 images and videos captured from user's mobile devices. Users can upload,
 access, manage and share personal content using web interface as well as
 a mobile application. To preserve user privacy and personalized data,
 part of the framework was developed in a private cloud environment. This
 work also reports the engineering aspects of development of ShaMoCloud.
 The software construction team previously developed similar applications

  Abstract                 = {{Requirement change management (RCM) is a critical activity during
 software development because poor RCM results in occurrence of defects,
 thereby resulting in software failure. To achieve RCM, efficient impact
 analysis is mandatory. A common repository is a good approach to
 maintain changed requirements, reusing and reducing effort. Thus, a
 better approach is needed to tailor knowledge for better change
 management of requirements and architecture during global software
 development (GSD). The objective of this research is to introduce an
 innovative approach for handling requirements and architecture changes
 simultaneously during global software development. The approach makes
 use of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and agile practices. Agile practices
 make our approach iterative, whereas CBR stores requirements and makes
 them reusable. Twin Peaks is our base model, meaning that requirements
 and architecture are handled simultaneously. For this research, grounded
 theory has been applied; similarly, interviews from domain experts were
 conducted. Interview and literature transcripts formed the basis of data
 collection in grounded theory. Physical saturation of theory has been
 achieved through a published case study and developed tool. Expert
 reviews and statistical analysis have been used for evaluation. The
 proposed approach resulted in effective change management of
 requirements and architecture simultaneously during global software

 product has a life cycle. Just as living beings, it is born, it

 The Product Life Cycle Theory. One or generally more projects and
 various operational works accompany the product throughout the product
 life. In this study, the effects of applying agile project management
 principles on product's life cycle are analyzed. In order to receive
 effective results from the agile project that accompany the product,
 project is suggested to be divided into phases and these phases are
 proposed to be differentiated according to the stage of the product.
 Furthermore, Product Life-time Project concept is introduced with agile
 methodologies. It reserves a project and its team to a specific product

 development of their product practices and design processes. The
 development of models and methods will allow for rapid real-time virtual
 prototyping of complex machines and machine fleets that operate within a
 number of worksites or geographical conditions. The introduction of this
 state-of-the art (and going beyond) advancement in real-time virtual
 technology, simulation, interne based design technologies and software,
 cyber-physical and big data processing systems, will present a holistic
 approach to improve the entire product life. Targeted user groups are
 manufacturers of non-road mobile machinery (i.e. excavators, wheel
 loaders, etc.). These machines and production systems share the
 following key features: 1) They are complex mechatronic systems with
 several interconnections between hydraulic drives; mechanics,
 electronics, software and 2) they include autonomous, semiautonomous and
 human driven operated systems. Methods developed will enable machine
 manufacturers' access to technologies that will lead to a more cost
 effective consumer ordinated, life cycle optimization process.
 This paper will introduce the method of developing customized products
 in a fast, agile and networked way that will lead to significantly
 reduced life-cycle costs.}},

  Abstract                 = {{this practice paper presents how a test team of a software engineering
 organization spread across three countries successfully optimized the
 system testing effort for a large mission-critical software system that
 had to conform to regulatory requirements. Multiple releases of the
 system of the system have been delivered to customers over the 15 years
 it has been in the market. Each new release added new features, which
 increased both the number of system test cases required and the
 complexity of the existing system test cases. Hence, a complete cycle of
 system testing for every new release required more time and effort.
 However, it was increasingly difficult to justify or arrange for such
 added efforts, especially since shorter product releases were being
 demanded. This created a vicious cycle where the team members, though
 experienced and highly-skilled, were unable to focus on initiatives to
 improve and optimize testing. To address this issue, we introduced the
 role of a test analyst to bridge the gap between the test team and other
 key stakeholders. We were able to optimize the total number of system
 test cases and increase test execution efficiency while ensuring
 conformance to mandatory regulations. The practices adapted by the team
 for faster test environment preparation, assisted automation, along with
 training and mentoring are described.}},

 challenges to understand the operation of individual outlets and the
 holistic performance of retail chains. As a result, both the IT systems

 software development methods. That is why, the combination of software
 architecting and agile methods has been in the focus of numerous
 publications. However, there is little literature on how to approach
 software architecting in agile projects in education. In this paper, we
 present our approach to the introduction of software architecting
 activities in an agile project course. The approach is based on
 literature sources and is tailored to fit our educational goals and
 context. The approach has been applied in two consecutive executions of
 the course. We observe improved understanding on the value of
 architecting activities and appreciation among students on the
 combination of architecting activities and agile development. We applied
 the approach predominantly in cases with an architecturally savvy
 Product Owner. Further research is required to understand how the
 approach performs in scenarios with architecturally unsavvy Product
 Owners and if it needs to be adapted for these scenarios. We also
 conclude that more research is needed on the challenges that architects
 face in agile projects in order to better prepare students for practice.

 the sprint will cause aggregation of test cases in the suite and may
 effect the time to delivery of product to the customer. To overcome this
 issue of late delivery, an approach of test case selection is proposed

  Abstract                 = {{Modern software development relies on incremental delivery to facilitate
 quick response to customers' requests. In this dynamic environment the
 continuous modifications of software code can cause risks for software
 developers; when developing a new feature increment, the added or
 modified code may contain fault-prone or difficult-to-maintain elements.
 The outcome of these risks can be defective software or decreased
 development velocity. This study presents a method to identify the risky
 areas and assess the risk when developing software code in Lean/Agile
 environment. We have conducted an action research project in two large
 companies, Ericsson AB and Volvo Group Truck Technology. During the
 study we have measured a set of code properties and investigated their
 influence on risk. The results show that the superposition of two
 metrics, complexity and revisions of a source code file, can effectively
 enable identification and assessment of the risk. We also illustrate how
 this kind of assessment can be successfully used by software developers
 to manage risks on a weekly basis as well as releasewise. A measurement
 system for systematic risk assessment has been introduced to two

 The study was conducted using a questionnaire with 207 software

 test) was conducted to investigate the relationship of Agile usage with
 (i) language, (ii) place of education and (iii) organization types.
 Results showed Agile usage has significant association with the two
 aspects; (i) language and (ii) organization types. It is suggested that
 these two aspects must be taken into consideration if one organization
 plans to adopt the methods. The results also revealed that many of the
 Agile users are not being exposed to the method before they start using
 it. We aim to provide knowledge and evidence on the suitability of Agile
 methods to the people in the country and nearby region.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Automated testing is a basic principle of agile development. Its
 benefits include early defect detection, defect cause localization and
 removal of fear to apply changes to the code. Therefore, maintaining
 high quality test code is essential. This study introduces a model that
 assesses test code quality by combining source code metrics that reflect
 three main aspects of test code quality: completeness, effectiveness and
 maintainability. The model is inspired by the Software Quality Model of
 the Software Improvement Group which aggregates source code metrics into
 quality ratings based on benchmarking. To validate the model we assess
 the relation between test code quality, as measured by the model, and
 issue handling performance. An experiment is conducted in which the test
 code quality model is applied to 18 open source systems. The test
 quality ratings are tested for correlation with issue handling
 indicators, which are obtained by mining issue repositories. In
 particular, we study the (1) defect resolution speed, (2) throughput and
 (3) productivity issue handling metrics. The results reveal a
 significant positive correlation between test code quality and two out
 of the three issue handling metrics (throughput and productivity),
 indicating that good test code quality positively influences issue
 handling performance.}},

 enabler for today's enterprises and will become even more important with
 the advent of cloud computing on the one hand and an ever more agile

 distributed computing technologies in the last three decades has
 delivered a rich set of platforms and paradigms for building robust
 enterprise systems, it has also left a legacy of unresolved problems
 including fundamental inconsistencies between the concepts of the two
 leading distributed computing paradigms, i.e., distributed object
 computing and service-oriented architecture. Equally important, there is
 a growing need to lower the complexities and barriers involved in
 developing client applications, which range from large scale business
 applications and business processes to laptop programs and small apps on
 mobile devices. In this article, we present a unified conceptual
 framework for service-oriented computing based on the proven MDA (Model
 Driven Architecture) terminology stack. With the conceptual framework we
 consolidate, and give semantics to, core concepts of service-oriented
 computing and provide a set of foundational model transformation
 patterns that map between the presented concepts and further clarify
 practical service-oriented computing scenarios. Finally, we show how the
 developed framework perfectly fits to the OSM (Orthographical Software

 development of new ideas envisioning the opportunities of combining
 Internet and Services. The ``Future Internet{''} (FI) concept has been

 refer to the well-founded Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) as the
 reference paradigm for FI computing. SOC promotes the idea of assembling
 application services into a network of services that can be loosely
 coupled to create flexible, dynamic business processes and agile
 software systems, which span organizations and computing platforms.
 Service composition approaches will certainly have an important role in
 shaping the SOC within the vision of FI. Despite the great interest in
 Service Composition, no common foundations and principles have been
 established yet for the FI of Services. Developing FI applications
 encompasses a variety of aspects, ranging from modeling and analysis
 issues in the early phases of their development, to issues related to
 their implementation and run-time management. This thematic series
 brings together innovative contributions to the research and development
 of novel service composition approaches to assist the design,

  Abstract                 = {{Software development practitioners are increasingly interested in
 adopting agile methods and generally recommend customisation so that the
 adopted method can fit the organisational reality. Many studies from the
 literature report agile adoption and customisation experiences but most
 of them are hardly generalisable and few are metric-based. They
 therefore cannot provide quantitative evidence of the suitability of the
 customised agile method, neither assess the organisation readability to
 adopt it, nor help in decision-making concerning the organisation
 transformation strategy.
 In this paper, we first describe the Agile Methods Quality-Integrated
 Customisation framework (AM-QuICk) that relies on measurements and aims
 to continuously assist agile methodologists throughout the agile
 adoption and customisation process, i.e., during the initial
 organisation adoption, the method design and throughout the working
 development process.
 Then, we present a case study using AM-QuICk within an organisation.
 With this study, we aim to analyse the current development process and
 its level of agility and identify the initial risk factors. The data
 were collected using preliminary interviews with the different team
 members and two questionnaires. The results reveal that though most
 respondents are enthusiastic towards agile principles, a progressive
 transformation strategy would be beneficial.}},

 agile project management (APM) framework compared to the traditional
 waterfall model, and understand how it can help companies add value and
 gain competitive advantage.
 Design/methodology/approach - The methodology used was the exploratory
 qualitative research through a case study of a software project,
 developed with the support and application of the Scrum framework, in a
 pharmaceutical industry information technology project.
 Findings - There were benefits found in the utilization of the agile
 framework, such as increased motivation and staff satisfaction, better
 control of requirements and especially higher quality of the delivered
 system, generating added value to the organization. Additionally, the
 project allowed the use of features from the first month of the
 application deployed, enabling a 75 percent reduction in development
 time, compared to traditional methods. The software development time was
 four months, 30 percent of what would be the total if the traditional
 methodology was adopted. Based on the results, the agile framework,
 especially the Scrum, proved to be a viable option as a project
 management approach.
 Research limitations/implications - Since this research is an
 exploratory case study, its results cannot be generalized.
 Practical implications - The paper provides relevant practical
 information and experiences to managers interested in implementing APM,
 as well as those interested in improving the management of projects.
 Originality/value - This paper provides a case study with practical
 implications of using APM, and APM's benefits and advantages are
 compared with the traditional waterfall approach. Companies can use this
 case study to better understand about the advantages and strengths of
 APM over the traditional approach.}},

 needs through the omission or alteration of aspects of the method. In
 many cases, aspects of an agile method that are most related to learning
 were those that were modified or omitted. This paper utilizes the
 results of these studies to identify common and emergent barriers to
 learning. Often these barriers to learning exist according to
 organizational culture and the extent to which that culture influences

  Abstract                 = {{A security-enhanced agile software development process, SEAP, is
 introduced in the development of a mobile money transfer system at
 Ericsson Corp. A specific characteristic of SEAP is that it includes a
 security group consisting of four different competences, i.e., security
 manager, security architect, security master and penetration tester.
 Another significant feature of SEAP is an integrated risk analysis
 process. In analyzing risks in the development of the mobile money
 transfer system, a general finding was that SEAP either solves risks
 that were previously postponed or solves a larger proportion of the
 risks in a timely manner. The previous software development process,
 i.e., the baseline process of the comparison outlined in this paper,
 required 2.7 employee hours spent for every risk identified in the
 analysis process compared to, on the average, 1.5 hours for the SEAP.
 The baseline development process left 50\% of the risks unattended in
 the software version being developed, while SEAP reduced that figure to
 22\%. Furthermore, SEAP increased the proportion of risks that were
 corrected from 12.5\% to 67.1\%, i.e., more than a five times increment.
 This is important, since an early correction may avoid severe attacks in
 the future. The security competence in SEAP accounts for 5\% of the
 personnel cost in the mobile money transfer system project. As a
 comparison, the corresponding figure, i.e., for security, was 1\% in the
 previous development process.}},

 Furthermore, the maintenance of large deployments of complex and rapidly

 virtual images and contextualization techniques. Such infrastructures
 are being deployed in some large centres (see e.g. the CERN Agile
 Infrastructure project), but with several open-source tools reaching

 contribution we describe the Private Cloud infrastructure at the
 INFN-Torino Computer Centre, that hosts a full-fledged WLCG Tier-2
 centre, an Interactive Analysis Facility for the ALICE experiment at the
 CERN LHC and several smaller scientific computing applications. The
 private cloud building blocks include the Open Nebula software stack,
 the GlusterFS filesystem and the OpenWRT Linux distribution (used for

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Large-scale offshore software development programmes are
 complex, with challenging deadlines and a high risk of failure. Agile
 methods are being adopted, despite the challenges of coordinating
 multiple development teams. Agile processes are tailored to support team
 coordination. Artefacts are tangible products of the software
 development process, intended to ensure consistency in the approach of
 teams on the same development programme.
 Objective: This study aims to increase understanding of how development
 processes are tailored to meet the needs of large-scale offshore
 software development programmes, by focusing on artefact inventories
 used in the development process.
 Method: A grounded theory approach using 46 practitioner interviews,
 supplemented with documentary sources and observations, in nine
 international companies was adopted. The grounded theory concepts of
 open coding, memoing, constant comparison and saturation were used in
 data analysis.
 Results: The study has identified 25 artefacts, organised into five
 categories: feature, sprint, release, product and corporate governance.
 It was discovered that conventional agile artefacts are enriched with
 artefacts associated with plan-based methods in order to provide
 governance. The empirical evidence collected in the study has been used
 to identify a primary owner of each artefact and map each artefact to
 specific activities within each of the agile roles.
 Conclusion: The development programmes in this study create agile and
 plan-based artefacts to improve compliance with enterprise quality
 standards and technology strategies, whilst also mitigating risk of
 failure. Management of these additional artefacts is currently
 improvised because agile development processes lack corresponding
 ceremonies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Agile software development generally refers to popular practices that
 are supposed to adhere to the Agile Manifesto with its values and
 principles. Empirical studies on agile software development have mainly
 focused on organizational adoption and impacts of agile practices.
 Furthermore, the literature on agile software development has mostly
 centered on small, co-located projects. However, agility is needed for
 software development projects of varied sizes in different organizations
 across industries. The general nature of agile values and principles and
 the procedure-driven nature of specific agile methods make it difficult
 for organizations to determine what they can do to effectively
 facilitate agility in their software development process. To bridge that
 literature gap and based on an evolved grounded-theory approach, this
 study identifies nine agility facilitators and their corresponding
 dimensions that extend beyond small, co-located projects to software
 projects of any size and distribution. These agility facilitators are
 further grouped into two categories: organizational foundation and
 project processes. In addition, the authors identify four dimensions of
 agility. The authors propose a framework that describes the
 organizational mechanisms through which the nine categories of
 facilitators lead to software development agility.}},

 interviewed eight project teams that were using iterative incremental
 lifecycles. In the study, we captured the practices the teams felt

 minimize disruption and delay. In this paper, we elaborate one practice
 from the study, prototyping with quality attribute focus. We compared
 two experiences in prototyping focused on quality attribute
 considerations applied on Scrum projects. We observe through interviews
 that feature development and prototyping practice spans multiple levels:
 feature development/sprint, release planning, and portfolio planning. We
 also observe other factors including rapid trade-off analysis, flexible
 architecture, and adoption of a set of enabling prototyping guidelines.
 The analysis of the observations sheds light on several aspects of the
 practice that enable the team to respond quickly and efficiently when
 prototype feedback suggests architectural change.}},

 the introduction of a more structured decision support method in agile

 promoted in the last 15 years, there is no agreement on how to determine

 consider agility as strict usage of a specific methodology, e. g. SCRUM,
 others consider agility as adhering to Agile Manifesto. The lack of
 common view on ASD prevents creating common guidelines on when the usage
 of ASD is appropriate. This paper presents a model of ASD that helps to
 differentiate it from the traditional, phase-based development, and more
 strictly defines the area of its applicability. The model has been built
 based on the knowledge transformation perspective, as the author
 considers it to be the most differentiating perspective when comparing
 ASD to traditional software development. For building the model, the
 ideas from SECI model of Nonaka have been exploited. The results, in the
 form of requirements to be fulfilled for successful employment of ASD,
 are demonstrated through analysis of completed ASD projects.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Due to the increasing popularity of Agile Software Development (ASD),
 more software development teams are planning to transit to ASD. As ASD
 substantially differs from the traditional Software Development (TSD),
 there are a number of issues and challenges that needs to be overcome

 acquiring an agile ``mindset{''}. The question arises whether it is
 possible to acquire this mindset with the minimum disruption of an
 already established TSD process. The paper tries to answer this question
 by developing a non-disruptive method of transition to ASD, while using
 a knowledge transformation perspective to identify the main features of
 ASD mindset and how it differs from the one of TSD. To map the current
 mindset and plan the movement to the mindset that is more agile, the
 paper suggests using a process modelling technique that considers the
 development process as a socio-technical system with components that
 correspond to the phases of the development process. The method
 suggested in the paper has been designed in connection to a business
 case of a development team interested to transit to agility in a

 perennial quandary for leaders: Should you attempt to borrow new ideas,
 and if so, which ones and how? Even the most promising practices can be
 disastrous if they're transplanted into the wrong company, writes Julian
 Birkinshaw of London Business School.
 Broadly speaking, there are two ways to borrow from innovative
 companies, he argues. The first, observe and apply, is the most commonly
 used approach for adopting new management ideas. It can and does work
 well, but only under limited sets of circumstances: when the observed
 practice easily stands alone or involves just a small constellation of
 supporting behaviors (think of GE's well-regarded succession-planning
 process) and when a company's management model or way of thinking is
 very similar to the originator's (think of two software firms that both
 use the Agile development approach).
 The second method is to extract a management practice's essential
 principle-its underlying logic-and ask a series of questions to
 determine if it is right for your firm, including: How is your company
 different from the originating firm? Are the goals of the practice
 important to your organization?
 Many management innovations are launched with great fanfare, only to
 fade in popularity. With careful analysis, you can avoid falling prey to
 this hype cycle. And even if it turns out that a borrowed idea isn't
 right for you, the analysis will help you better understand your own
 management models and sharpen your practices.}},

 of teams, better training approaches, and optimizing software
 development efforts by focusing on key desirable components of agile.
 This study, using a grounded theory methodology, finds a variety of
 categories of factors that influence software developer preference for
 agile methods including self-efficacy, affective response, interpersonal
 response, external contingencies, and personality contingencies. Each of
 these categories contains multiple dimensions. Preference
 rationalization for agile methods is the core category that emerges from
 the data. It informs that while the very essence of agile methods
 overwhelmingly and positively resonates with software developers, the
 preference is contingent on external and personality factors as well.}},

  Abstract                 = {{It is a conundrum that agile projects can succeed `without requirements'
 when weak requirements engineering is a known cause for project
 failures. While Agile development projects often manage well without
 extensive requirements documentation, test cases are commonly used as
 requirements. We have investigated this agile practice at three
 companies in order to understand how test cases can fill the role of
 requirements. We performed a case study based on twelve interviews
 performed in a previous study. The findings include a range of benefits
 and challenges in using test cases for eliciting, validating, verifying,
 tracing and managing requirements. In addition, we identified three
 scenarios for applying the practice, namely as a mature practice, as a
 de facto practice and as part of an agile transition. The findings
 provide insights into how the role of requirements may be met in agile
 development including challenges to consider.}},

 capable of helping in the development of quality and successful software
 in business environments. However, most of these methodologies are
 centered on a development team and its internal communication. Moreover,
 for simplicity, a single product development is taken into account with
 its successive releases. There is another scenario: that of a single
 programmer working alone and often in much smaller projects and in
 several at the same time. Also in this scenario the client proximity is
 not as described by the agile environment ideal. In that case, the
 priorities and needs change, communication takes on another meaning and
 working mechanisms are not always comparable to that of a team. This
 paper introduces Faat (Freelance as a Team), a methodology specifically
 designed for those professionals. Integrating existing practices to the

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Continuous Integration (Cl) has become an established best
 practice of modern software development. Its philosophy of regularly
 integrating the changes of individual developers with the master code
 base saves the entire development team from descending into Integration
 Hell, a term coined in the field of extreme programming. In practice, CI
 is supported by automated tools to cope with this repeated integration
 of source code through automated builds and testing. One of the main
 problems, however, is that relevant information about the quality and
 health of a software system is both scattered across those tools and
 across multiple views.
 Objective: This paper introduces a quality awareness framework for
 CI-data and its conceptional model used for the data integration and
 visualization. The framework called SQA-Mashup makes use of the
 service-based mashup paradigm and integrates information from the entire
 Cl-toolchain into a single service.
 Method: The research approach followed in our work consists out of (i) a
 conceptional model for data integration and visualization, (ii) a
 prototypical framework implementation based on tool requirements derived
 from literature, and (iii) a controlled user study to evaluate its
 usefulness.
 Results: The results of the controlled user study showed that
 SQA-Mashup's single point of access allows users to answer questions
 regarding the state of a system more quickly (57\%) and accurately
 (21.6\%) than with standalone CI-tools.
 Conclusions: The SQA-Mashup framework can serve as one-stop shop for
 software quality data monitoring in a software development project. It
 enables easy access to CI-data which otherwise is not integrated but
 scattered across multiple Cl-tools. Our dynamic visualization approach
 allows for a tailoring of integrated CI-data according to information
 needs of different stakeholders such as developers or testers. (c) 2014

  Abstract                 = {{There is an acknowledged need for teaching realistic software
 development in project courses. The design space for such courses is
 wide, ranging from single-semester to two-semester courses, from
 single-client to multicustomer courses, from local to globally
 distributed courses, and from toy projects to projects with real
 clients. The challenge for a nontrivial project course is how to make
 the project complex enough to enrich students' software engineering
 experience, yet realistic enough to have a teaching environment that
 does not unduly burden students or the instructor. We describe a
 methodology for project courses that is realizable for instructors,
 improves students' skills, and leads to viable results for industry
 partners.
 In particular, recent advances in release management and collaboration
 workflows reduce the effort of students and instructors during delivery
 and increase the quality of the deliverables. To enable release and
 feedback management, we introduce Rugby, an agile process model based on
 Scrum that allows reacting to changing requirements. To improve early
 communication, we use Tornado, a scenario-based design approach that
 emphasizes the use of informal models for the interaction between
 clients and students. The combination of Rugby and Tornado allows
 students to deal with changing requirements, produce multiple releases,
 and obtain client feedback through the duration of the course.
 We describe our experience with more than 300 students working on 40
 projects with external clients over a 4-year period. In the latest
 instance of our course, the students have produced more than 7000 builds
 with 600 releases for eleven clients. In an evaluation of the courses,
 we found that the introduction of Rugby and Tornado significantly
 increased students' technical skills, especially with respect to
 software engineering, usability engineering, and configuration
 management, as well as their nontechnical skills such as communication
 with the client, teamwork, presentation, and demo management. Finally,
 we discuss how other instructors can adapt the course concept.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Model transformations are a mandatory requirement for model-driven
 development, a software engineering discipline, which has become more
 and more popular during the last decade. Over the years, the concept of
 unidirectional model transformations and corresponding tool support
 reached maturity since these kind of transformations are widely used in
 model-driven engineering, mainly for forward engineering and code
 generation. In incremental and iterative software engineering processes,
 forward engineering may be too restrictive since it resembles
 waterfall-like processes. Thus, bidirectional transformations are
 required, which aim to provide support for (incrementally) transforming
 one or more source model to one or more target model and vice versa from
 only one transformation description. However, they seem to be rarely
 used in model-driven software development as adequate tool support is
 missing. On the other hand, programming languages nowadays provide
 support for higher-level features like closures or lambda expressions
 which allow to describe transformation patterns in a declarative way. In
 this paper, we present an approach for round-trip engineering between
 UML class models and Java source code, which is realized with a triple
 graph transformation system written in the Xtend programming language.}},

 software development methodology. Different development approaches had
 been introduced but only a few are still functioning in the software
 industry. Agile software development is one approach, which is currently
 successful in software industry. For the development of interactive and
 usable software, this agile approach needs to integrate with usability
 approaches. But this integration is not clear as both agile and
 usability follows iterative approach of development while agile approach
 is more toward on writing code and development of a running system;
 whereas, usability focused on the user interface to make the software
 more usable and increase its usability by following UCD process. This
 paper provides an extensive related work on the integration of agile
 methods with usability that highlights critical issues in agile methods
 and shows the importance of usability in agile methods. In the end, the
 proposed model is discussed to handle tradeoff between usability and

  Abstract                 = {{The purpose of the Observatory Software System (OSW) is to integrate all
 software and hardware components of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) to
 enable observations and data capture; thus it is a complex software
 system that is defined by four principal software subsystems: Common
 Software (CSW), Executive Software (ESW), Data Management System (DMS)
 and Science Operations Support System (SOSS), all of which have
 interdependencies with the observatory control systems and data
 acquisition systems. Therefore, the software development process and
 plan must consider dependencies to other subsystems, manage
 architecture, interfaces and design, manage software scope and
 complexity, and standardize and optimize use of resources and tools.
 Additionally, the TMT Observatory Software will largely be developed in
 India through TMT's workshare relationship with the India TMT
 Coordination Centre (ITCC) and use of Indian software industry vendors,
 which adds complexity and challenges to the software development
 process, communication and coordination of activities and priorities as
 well as measuring performance and managing quality and risk. The
 software project management challenge for the TMT OSW is thus a
 multi-faceted technical, managerial, communications and interpersonal
 relations challenge. The approach TMT is using to manage this
 multi-faceted challenge is a combination of establishing an effective
 geographically distributed software team (Integrated Product Team) with
 strong project management and technical leadership provided by the TMT
 Project Office (PO) and the ITCC partner to manage plans, process,
 performance, risk and quality, and to facilitate effective
 communications; establishing an effective cross-functional software
 management team composed of stakeholders, OSW leadership and ITCC
 leadership to manage dependencies and software release plans, technical
 complexities and change to approved interfaces, architecture, design and
 tool set, and to facilitate effective communications; adopting an
 agile-based software development process across the observatory to
 enable frequent software releases to help mitigate subsystem
 interdependencies; defining concise scope and work packages for each of
 the OSW subsystems to facilitate effective outsourcing of software
 deliverables to the ITCC partner, and to enable performance monitoring
 and risk management. At this stage, the architecture and high-level
 design of the software system has been established and reviewed. During
 construction each subsystem will have a final design phase with reviews,
 followed by implementation and testing. The results of the TMT approach
 to the Observatory Software development process will only be preliminary
 at the time of the submittal of this paper, but it is anticipated that
 the early results will be a favorable indication of progress.}},

 concerns that cause projects to fail. User-centered design (UCD) and
 agile software development are two iterative approaches that have been
 proposed to overcome such concerns. UCD is a design process focusing on
 user research, user interface design and usability evaluation.
 Introduced by software engineering practitioners, agile refers to a
 number of iterative and incremental software development practices that
 emphasize people's needs, communication between developers and
 stakeholders and the ability to adapt to change. In both the agile and
 UCD communities, however, a full understanding of user requirements is
 often seen as incompatible with early and quick development iterations.
 We performed a literature review aiming to identify how agile teams have
 integrated UCD tools into their agile software development process to a
 better understanding of the user requirements without losing sight of
 the agile values and principles. UCD tools adaptations and
 minimal-upfront design applied in agile development are among the
 approaches discovered in this study. The findings could lead to a
 comprehensive user-centric software engineering that will overcome
 inherent problems faced by agile teams to understand user needs,
 priorities and goals.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Mainstream programming languages provide built-in exception handling
 mechanisms to support robust and maintainable implementation of
 exception handling in software systems. Most of these modern languages,
 such as C\#, Ruby, Python and many others, are often claimed to have
 more appropriated exception handling mechanisms. They reduce programming
 constraints on exception handling to favor agile changes in the source
 code. These languages provide what we call maintenance-driven exception
 handling mechanisms. It is expected that the adoption of these
 mechanisms improve software maintainability without hindering software
 robustness. However, there is still little empirical knowledge about the
 impact that adopting these mechanisms have on software robustness. This
 paper addressed this gap by conducting an empirical study aimed at
 understanding the relationship between changes in C\# programs and their
 robustness. In particular, we evaluated how changes in the normal and
 exceptional code were related to exception handling faults. We applied a
 change impact analysis and a control flow analysis in 119 versions of 16
 C\# programs. The results showed that: (i) most of the problems
 hindering software robustness in those programs are caused by changes in
 the normal code, (ii) many potential faults were introduced even when
 improving exception handling in C\# code, and (iii) faults are often
 facilitated by the maintenancedriven flexibility of the exception
 handling mechanism. Moreover, we present a series of change scenarios
 that decrease the program robustness.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Non-functional requirements define the overall qualities or attributes
 of a system. Although important, they are often neglected for many
 reasons, such as pressure of time and budget. In agile software
 development, there is a focus on the feature implementation and delivery
 of value to the customer and, as such, non-functional aspects of a
 system should also be of attention. Non-functional requirements testing
 is challenging due its cross-functional aspects and lack of clarity of
 their needs by business in the most part of projects. The goal of this
 paper is to empirically investigate how do agile team members handle
 non-functional testing in their projects, aiming to identify preliminary
 factors influencing the testing of non-functional requirements,
 specifically performance and security in agile development. We conducted
 interviews with twenty IT professionals in large multinational company.
 As result we could identify seven main factors influencing
 non-functional testing and four main practices adopted by them to
 overcome the challenges faced. We aim to replicate our investigation in
 a larger scale. Meanwhile, our work provides initial contributions to
 practitioners and inspires our future research.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Background: The software development industry has been adopting agile
 methods instead of traditional software development methods because they
 are more flexible and can bring benefits such as handling requirements
 changes, productivity gains and business alignment. Objective: This
 study seeks to evaluate, synthesize, and present aspects of research on
 agile methods tailoring including the method tailoring approaches
 adopted and the criteria used for agile practice selection. Method: The
 method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on studies
 published from 2002 to 2014. Results: 56 out of 783 papers have been
 identified as describing agile method tailoring approaches. These
 studies have been identified as case studies regarding the empirical
 research, as solution proposals regarding the research type, and as
 evaluation studies regarding the research validation type. Most of the
 papers used method engineering to implement tailoring and were not
 specific to any agile method on their scope. Conclusion: Most of agile
 methods tailoring research papers proposed or improved a technique, were
 implemented as case studies analyzing one case in details and validated
 their findings using evaluation. Method engineering was the base for
 tailoring, the approaches are independent of agile method and the main
 criteria used are internal environment and objectives variables. (c)

  Abstract                 = {{The current U.S. Air Force's 30-year plan (America's Air Force: A Call
 to the Future, July 2014) identifies Capability Development as a key
 area where existing practices fall short and need to be transformed in
 order to keep pace with new threats and the evolving operational
 environment. The strategy recognizes that traditional DoD methods of
 requirements development, acquisition oversight, and especially systems
 engineering are inadequate to produce results in the desired timeframe,
 in a manner that is receptive to more frequent decision points and
 opportunities to change direction. In order for these types of systems
 to evolve and support the type of distributed participation and
 flexibility that the strategy envisions, they must be designed and (more
 importantly) specified to expose the necessary interfaces and exhibit
 sufficient modularity to allow for future growth. This adoption of an
 open-systems architecture approach represents a potentially significant
 engineering investment that must be accounted for in acquisition
 processes, and be made a first-class citizen in planning and scheduling
 activities. We believe that in order for the U.S. Air Force (and the
 defense community in general) to truly realize the benefits that come
 with implementation of agile Capability Development as outlined in the
 strategy, program offices must: 1) Strive to gain deep, technical
 knowledge of the system modularity; 2) Specify the critical interfaces
 to a level of detail to allow capability developers to implement
 functionality in software; 3) Be able to act as a system integrator to
 verify and validate that potential component implementations can
 interoperate successfully within the overall system to accomplish the
 desired mission. In this paper, we outline a systems engineering
 approach using a dynamic, executable Model-Based Engineering methodology
 that we believe can help the government create the systems engineering
 environment required to implement agile capability development and
 finally reap its benefits. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

 increased project flexibility is a common reaction to high levels of
 technological turbulence. However, existing definitions of project
 flexibility are inconsistent and sometimes unclear, and empirical
 evidence is limited.
 This article makes an important distinction between flexible project
 planning and, flexible project specifications. A negative relationship
 is found between flexible project planning and innovation project
 performance, whereas flexible product specifications are found to
 contribute positively. This article also examines how technological
 turbulence contributes to the choice of flexible or inflexible
 strategies. Technological turbulence can be present in the external
 environment or can be internal to the firm, when radically new products
 are developed. The findings suggest that when businesses perceive
 technological turbulence in the environment they are more likely to
 adopt flexible approaches to innovation in an attempt to adapt to
 external pressures. In technologically innovative projects, product
 specifications are likely to remain fixed while. project organization is
 likely to be adapted to the needs of the project:
 Taken together, the findings suggest that innovation projects should
 maintain stable organization, schedules and budgets, but stay flexible
 about product specifications. Vigilance with regards to external and
 internal conditions of technological turbulence, which may lead
 organizations to be more flexible in terms of project planning, is
 needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

 organizations, the ability to respond to changes in turbulent business
 environments, has been gaining wide adoption. Agile software development
 projects are characterized by `just enough' planning and lack of upfront
 commitment to scope, cost, and schedule. These characteristics pose
 conflicting demands on managers responsible for making funding
 decisions, because traditional approaches to funding IT projects are
 often based on well-defined scope, cost, and schedule. These conflicts
 demand the adaptation of traditional funding processes to suit to agile
 projects. We draw from Adaptive Structuration Theory to understand the
 nature of conflicts between traditional IT project funding processes and
 the dynamic nature of agile projects, and how these conflicts are
 addressed by practices that are appropriated in the process of social
 interaction between funding decision makers and development teams. On
 the basis of a multisite case study, we present a framework that
 explains how organizations adapt traditional IT funding approaches to
 accommodate the unique characteristics of agile IT projects. European

 development has been highlighted over the past ten years, where a
 significant amount of research has been done. Since the first systems
 using design rationale in the seventies and eighties to the more modern

 models, approaches, and research tools have leveraged the interests of
 researchers and practitioners in AK management (AKM). Capturing,
 sharing, and using AK has many benefits for software designers and
 maintainers, but the cost to capture this relevant knowledge hampers a
 widespread use by software companies. However, as the improvements made
 over the last decade didn't boost a wider adoption of AKM approaches,
 there is a need to identify the successes and shortcomings of current AK
 approaches and know what industry needs from AK. Therefore, as
 researchers and promoters of many of the AK research tools in the early
 stages where AK became relevant for the software architecture community,
 and based on our experience and observations, we provide in this
 research an informal retrospective analysis of what has been done and
 the challenges and trends for a future research agenda to promote AK use

  Abstract                 = {{In the beginning of the last decade, agile methodologies emerged as a
 response to software development processes that were based on rigid
 approaches. In fact, the flexible characteristics of agile methods are
 expected to be suitable to the less-defined and uncertain nature of
 software development. However, many studies in this area lack empirical
 evaluation in order to provide more confident evidences about which
 contexts the claims are true. This paper reports an empirical study
 performed to analyze the impact of Scrum adoption on customer
 satisfaction as an external success perspective for software development
 projects in a software intensive organization. The study uses data from
 real-life projects executed in a major software intensive organization
 located in a nation wide software ecosystem. The empirical method
 applied was a cross-sectional survey using a sample of 19 real-life
 software development projects involving 156 developers. The survey aimed
 to determine whether there is any impact on customer satisfaction caused
 by the Scrum adoption. However, considering that sample, our results
 indicate that it was not possible to establish any evidence that using
 Scrum may help to achieve customer satisfaction and, consequently,
 increase the success rates in software projects, in contrary to general
 claims made by Scrum' advocates.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is an ``outside-in{''} approach to
 software development built upon semi-formal mediums for specifying the
 behaviour of a system as it would be observed externally. Through the
 representation of a system as a collection of user stories and scenarios
 using BDD's notation, practitioners automate acceptance tests using
 examples of desired behaviour for the envisioned system. A formal model
 created in concert with BDD tests would provide valuable insight into
 test validity and enhance the visibility of the problem domain. This
 work called BHive builds upon the formal underpinnings of BDD scenarios
 by mapping their ``Given,{''} ``When,{''} and ``Then{''} statements to
 ``Precondition,{''} ``Command,{''} and `` Postcondition{''} constructs
 as introduced by Floyd-Hoare logic. We posit that this mapping allows
 for a B-Method representation to be created and that such a model is
 useful for exploring system behaviour and exposing gaps in requirements.
 We also outline extensions to BDD tooling required for the described
 integration and present benefits of the BHive approach to integrating
 formalism within a BDD project.}},

 project management, modeling, software construction, software testing.
 Extreme Programming (XP) is one of the methods more closely related to
 the construction phase. XP is widely adopted in the industry and offers
 practices that can be applied to several business contexts. The goal of
 this work is to propose guidelines and best practices towards service
 development, focused on the construction phase, in an SOA environment

 process must be applied to obtain, validate and maintain one or more

 differences between stakeholder's technical dialects, communication
 problems are constant, generating inconsistencies between the conceptual
 model and the problem to be solved. To help solving these issues an
 agile and cognitive modeling based approach supported by MDA based tools
 is proposed promoting better consistency between requirements and the
 conceptual models, guaranteed by specifying a mind map that serves as
 the basis for translating requirements to domain models, represented by
 the UML class diagrams and feature models. Thus, the main contribution
 of this work is to provide an interoperability tool to generate software
 models (e.g.: class diagrams and feature models) from mind maps. This
 tool provides the capability of transformation between different
 industrial mind map tools (including cloud tools -SaaS) to different
 domain modelling tools, both class diagrams and for feature models.
 Finally, a case study was applied to verify this feasibility and check
 this interoperability assessment. The main contribution is MindDomain

  Abstract                 = {{We consider the task of building Big Data software systems, offered as
 software-as-a-service. These applications are commonly backed by NoSQL
 data stores that address the proverbial Vs of Big Data processing: NoSQL
 data stores can handle large volumes of data and many systems do not
 enforce a global schema, to account for structural variety in data.
 Thus, software engineers can design the data model on the go, a
 flexibility that is particularly crucial in agile software development.
 However, NoSQL data stores commonly do not yet account for the veracity
 of changes when it comes to changes in the structure of persisted data.
 Yet this is an inevitable consequence of agile software development. In
 most NoSQL-based application stacks, schema evolution is completely
 handled within the application code, usually involving object mapper
 libraries. Yet simple code refactorings, such as renaming a class
 attribute at the source code level, can cause data loss or runtime
 errors once the application has been deployed to production. We address
 this pain point by contributing type checking rules that we have
 implemented within an IDE plugin. Our plugin ControVol statically type
 checks the object mapper class declarations against the code release
 history. ControVol is thus capable of detecting common yet risky cases
 of mismatched data and schema, and can even suggest automatic fixes.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Trust plays an important role in software development teams using Agile
 Methodology. Previous research reported that the Agile Methodology
 fosters trust between the development team and the product owner and
 subsequently the trust improves communications about requirements and
 expectations with the product owner, and promotes collaborations within
 the development team. This helped our understanding of the role of trust
 in Agile methodology; however, it failed to answer the question of why
 trust is so important in Agile methodology while it has not been so in
 traditional software development methods. In this paper we use a social
 complexity approach to investigate the software development process. By
 looking at software development as a complex endeavor, and using tools
 and techniques from the Cynefin framework and other models of social
 complexity, we demonstrate that the increased level of complexity of the
 software has led to an increase in the level of complexity of the
 software development process. It transforms the software development
 process from a simple and complicated process to a complex one. Trust,
 which functions to resolve complexity, becomes an important factor in
 such a software development environment. The Agile methodology, which
 fosters a higher level of trust in the development process, is able to
 manage the complexity more effectively than traditional software
 development methods in a complex software development environment, and
 hence is a favored option in such an environment.}},

 guide students in holistically designing and directing collaborative
 project development. Previous studies on MF have shown the technical
 benefits of monitoring student work and product quality. This study
 investigated the approach further, from the perspective of team
 management. The effects of MF were examined through an experiment with
 team-related hypotheses. The results revealed that MF significantly
 enhances a team's communication and coordination and balances members'
 contributions by giving mutual support and effort. It has relatively
 less influence, however, on student team cohesion.}},

 configuration as well as shortens the network function deployment time.
 Despite the projected benefits of an SDN, the abstractions toward the
 remote and centralized control tend to impose excessive control traffic
 overhead in order for the controller to acquire global network
 visibility as well as extend the legacy network's inaccurate and
 unreliable management problems into the control plane. In addition, many
 recent SDNs facilitate multiple management pillars (such as customized
 interfaces and protocols) so that user applications can directly
 communicate to the data plane to measure and monitor specific
 information. Not only logical control centralization, but also
 virtualization of the underlying computing and network resources add
 demands of more flexible and programmable monitoring functions per the
 virtual domain. A complex combination of multiple and heterogeneous
 management channels introduces the significant scalability, control
 tuning, and reliability problems in SDN. In this paper, to address the
 above control and management problems, we propose a highly scalable and
 reliable SDN control and management architecture, called IRIS Control
 and Management (IRIS-CoMan). It builds an intelligent agent based hybrid
 SDN architecture by providing a control and management abstraction and
 filtering layer. It serves an essential component for the reliable,
 scalable, and secure SDN deployment. We present design, implementation,
 deployment, and feasibility evaluation results of IRIS-CoMan.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Continuous Deployment (CD) is an emerging software development
 process with organisations such as Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM
 successfully implementing and using the process. The CD process aims to
 immediately deploy software to customers as soon as new code is
 developed, and can result in a number of benefits for organisations,
 such as: new business opportunities, reduced risk for each release, and
 prevent development of wasted software. There is little academic
 literature on the challenges organisations face when adopting the CD
 process, however there are many anecdotal challenges that organisations
 have voiced on their online blogs.
 Objective: The aim of this research is to examine the challenges faced
 by organisations when adopting CD as well as the strategies to mitigate
 these challenges.
 Method: An explorative case study technique that involves in-depth
 interviews with software practitioners in an organisation that has
 adopted CD was conducted to identify these challenges.
 Results: This study found a total of 20 technical and social adoption
 challenges that organisations may face when adopting the CD process. The
 results are discussed to gain a deeper understanding of the strategies
 employed by organisations to mitigate the impacts of these challenges.
 Conclusion: While a number of individual technical and social adoption
 challenges were uncovered by the case study in this research, most
 challenges were not faced in isolation. The severity of these challenges
 were reduced by a number of mitigation strategies employed by the case
 study organisation. It is concluded that organisations need to be well
 prepared to handle technical and social adoption challenges with their
 existing expertise, processes and tools before adopting the CD process.
 For practitioners, knowing how to address the challenges an organisation
 may face when adopting the CD process provides a level of awareness that
 they previously may not have had. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

 decades, with new programming technologies, the affordability of
 hardware, pervasive internet access and mobile computing all
 contributing to the emergence of new software development processes. The
 newer process initiatives, which include those which are sometimes
 referred to as agile or lean methods, have brought with them new terms,
 which sometimes reflect the introduction of novel concepts. Other times,
 new terms correspond to long established concepts that have been
 repackaged. The net position is that we have a proliferation of language
 and term usage in the software development process domain, a problem
 which has implications for assessors and assessment frameworks, and for
 the broader community. In this paper, we explore this problem, finding
 that it is worthy of further research. Plus, we identify a technique
 suited to addressing this concern: the establishment of a canonical
 software process ontological model.}},

 to define the observation uncertainty in terms of optical,

 an amended Agile Design Science Research Methodology (ADSRM). ADSRM
 draws upon breakthroughs made in industry by those adopting `agile'
 perspectives on IT development. This agile perspective balances
 procedural rigour with the need to consider empiricallydriven
 problem/solution coevolution, allowing development to hone in on the
 most meaningful and unanticipated of problems. ADSRM proposes amendments
 to several existing DSR best practices, as well as two entirely new
 components to be modelled in the design process, namely a problem
 backlog and a hardening sprint. The value of these additions is
 illustrated in two exemplar cases.}},

 of two software systems developed with Object Oriented technologies and
 Agile process. Micro patterns are design decisions in code that can be
 easily automatically recognised. Gil and Maman introduced the concept to
 support providing objective assessment of design decisions {[}1]. They
 catalogued 27 micro patterns that capture a variety of programming
 practices in Java. Micro patterns can be a useful metrics in order to
 measure the quality of software by showing that certain categories of
 micro patterns are more fault prone than others, and that the classes
 that do not correspond to any category of micro patterns are more likely
 to be faulty. In our study we present some empirical results on two case
 studies of systems developed with Agile methodologies, and compare them
 to previous results obtained for non Agile systems. In particular we
 have verified that the distribution of micro patterns in a software
 system developed using Agile methodologies does not differ from the
 distribution studied in other systems, and that the micro patterns
 fault-proneness is about the same. We also analyzed how the distribution
 of micro patterns changes in different releases of the same software
 system. We demonstrate that there is a relationship between the number
 of faults and the classes that do not match with any micro patterns. We
 found that these classes are more likely to be fault-prone than the
 others even in software developed with Agile methodologies.}},

 to solve the issues present in the mobile domain. Moreover, there is a
 lack of evidence that shows a clear link between the proposed
 methodologies and their utilization in a real-world setting. Finally,
 the rapid evolution of the mobile environment challenges several of the
 premises upon which the proposed methodologies were created. In this
 paper, we present a review on Agile software development processes for
 mobile applications and their implementations, with the objective of
 knowing the contribution of Agile methods to address the needs of the
 mobile software in a production environment. Our goal is to introduce
 discussion on the need of conducting research that unveils what is the

 demonstrated to be comparable to the close source ones and in many cases
 even higher and the effectiveness of agile approaches has been
 demonstrated in many industrial settings. Moreover, the availability of
 the source code makes open source products attractive for obvious
 reasons (e.g., security, long term maintenance, etc.). Following this
 trend, also the Italian Army has started using open source software and
 promotes its usage into the development processes of its contractors,

 actually adopt and use agile remains unclear. Based on five case
 studies, this research seeks to apply the concepts from management
 fashion theory to understand how organizations mindfully (or mindlessly)
 adopt agile methods. We find in some cases that agile appears to be
 characterized as a short-term, transitory trend, while in others it is
 embedded in an organization's processes and culture. We identify three
 categories that distinguish between fashion patterns during agile
 adoptions: Crusaders, who exclusively adopt agile in a pure form;
 Tailors, who integrate agile and traditional approaches to fit their
 specific circumstances; and Dabblers who employ a few ceremonial agile
 activities alongside a traditional approach. The results from this study
 can encourage managerial awareness of the link between fashions and
 agile development, which can serve to highlight the unique opportunities
 to enhance mindfulness and avoid the pitfalls of mindlessness. By
 uncovering insights into the fashion-centric drivers of agile adoption,
 this research extends past theory related to both mindful innovation and
 management fashions.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper introduces a multi-tiered test automation architecture to
 optimize test automation in an Agile software development environment
 while increasing both the test coverage and depth of each tier. Test
 Automation is the act of converting manual test cases into automated
 scripts that can be executed autonomously. In general, testing accounts
 for roughly 60\% of the overall development budget and approximately
 50\% of that is attributed to regression testing. In recent years
 software organizations have begun migrating to Agile software
 development practices and automated testing in hopes of reducing the
 cost, lengthy regression cycles, and time to market. Traditionally, test
 automation is conducted on stable, non-changing applications. In an
 Agile environment where the code constantly changes, automated test
 cases become obsolete and must constantly be refactored in order to
 provide meaningful feedback about the system's quality. In most
 instances the cost of maintenance of automated test code completely
 overshadows the entire automation effort and negates any possible Return
 on Investment (Rol). An n-Tiered Test Automation Architecture seeks to
 retain the Rol by abstracting the automation project into separate
 distinct tiers; Presentation, Business, Data, and Services. These
 abstractions allow automated testing to continue providing feedback
 despite the constant revision of the system. A case study was conducted
 using this method and the observations showed that the automation
 architecture was resilient to change while increasing the test coverage,
 the depth of testing, and the overall quality of the application under
 test. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Purpose - This paper presents an IT system - Student Connectivity Module
 (SCM) - designed to support administration of student exchange between
 universities in different countries, developed under the EU seventh
 Framework Program. The purpose of this paper is to share the acquired
 knowledge on existing difficulties in mobility management, propose
 solutions to those problems, and present results of system validation
 using its prototype deployed at two universities.
 Design/methodology/approach - Prior to the system design, the needs,
 plans and expectations concerning the academic IT services were surveyed
 among 100 universities. On this basis, in close with prospective system
 users, an original peer-to-peer system was developed using top-down
 model-driven and agile software development techniques.
 Findings - The barriers to effective interoperation of academic
 information systems (AIS) were revealed: first, diversity and
 heterogeneity of campus IT solutions; second, differences in patterns of
 international student mobility flow; third, diversity in national
 personal data protection policies; and fourth, lack of standards for
 e-data exchange. The SCM system overcomes these problems by adopting
 platform-independent IT solutions, web-services, a network of trusted
 authority servers, and a novel ``quasi-standard{''} solution for e-data
 exchange, with the use of home university campus cards to access
 facilities at host institutions.
 Originality/value - The management of foreign student exchange is a
 complicated process. It involves students, faculty, administrative staff
 and external institutions. To the authors knowledge, there is no other
 comprehensive networked IT system available to facilitate administration
 of student mobility, make it better controlled, less laborious and
 faster, in a secure way. The IT solution contributes to overcoming the
 current barriers to academic mobility within Europe and elsewhere.}},

 more simplified. This flexibility requires online routing updates, but
 during these updates, consistency has to be preserved, i.e., no packet
 losses or unrecognized duplications should occur. Moreover, routing
 updates should be done on the fly in an application-seamless fashion.
 Where no significant irregular delays or ``communication hiccups{''} in
 packet arrivals are introduced due to the (frequent) updates. In this
 paper we present the first seamless consistency during on-the-fly
 routing updates, allowing the sender to send packets in an unchanged
 rate during the entire process, rate that is identical to the rate prior
 and after the update. The main idea is to use multicast on portions of
 the route, i.e., to send a packet both in the old and the new routes and
 only when the controller verifies the establishment and operation of the
 specific portion of the new route, it can remove the corresponding
 portion from the old route.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Software Product Line Engineering implies the upfront design of
 a Product-Line Architecture (PLA) from which individual product
 applications can be engineered. The big upfront design associated with
 PLAs is in conflict with the current need of ``being open to change. To
 make the development of product-lines more flexible and adaptable to
 changes, several companies are adopting Agile Product Line Engineering.
 However, to put Agile Product Line Engineering into practice it is still
 necessary to make mechanisms available to assist and guide the agile
 construction and evolution of PLAs.
 Objective: This paper presents the validation of a process for ``the
 agile construction and evolution of product-line architectures{''},
 called Agile Product-Line Architecting (APLA). The contribution of the
 APLA process is the integration of a set of models for describing,
 documenting, and tracing PLAs, as well as an algorithm for guiding the
 change decision-making process of PLAs. The APLA process is assessed to
 prove that assists Agile Product Line Engineering practitioners in the
 construction and evolution of PLAs.
 Method: Validation is performed through a case study by using both
 quantitative and qualitative analysis. Quantitative analysis was
 performed using statistics, whereas qualitative analysis was performed
 through interviews using constant comparison, triangulation, and
 supporting tools. This case study was conducted according to the
 guidelines of Runeson and Host in a software factory where three
 projects in the domain of Smart Grids were involved.
 Results: APLA is deployed through the Flexible-PLA modeling framework.
 This framework supported the successful development and evolution of the
 PLA of a family of power metering management applications for Smart
 Grids.
 Conclusions: APLA is a well-supported solution for the agile
 construction and evolution of PLAs. This case study illustrates that the
 proposed solution for the agile construction of PLAs is viable in an
 industry project on Smart Grids. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  Abstract                 = {{Even though agile actively seeks collaboration from all its
 stakeholders, most agile projects do not extend themselves toward the
 operations people. To solve this problem, DevOps is introduced. DevOps
 is a conceptual framework for reintegrating development and operations
 of Information Systems, which is able to break the wall between
 developers and operations professionals. DevOps improves the work
 through a collection of principles and practices, centered around close
 collaboration between Development and Operations personnel. However,
 both sides have paid little attention to issues faced by each other.
 Communication gaps is a recurrent problem in agile teams that is also
 eminent in the relationship between developers and operations.
 Literature offers little research on this aspect of communication in
 DevOps. This position paper describes the communication practices from a
 distributed agile team composed of developers and operations based on
 communication challenges (geographical, socio-cultural, and temporal
 distance) and strategies (frequency, direction, modality, and content).
 From the results we outline possible research focus for future work,
 aiming to enrich the academia research on the matter as well as to help
 practitioners to improve their working practices.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Nowadays, the design of software systems is pushed towards agile
 development practices. One of its most fundamental approaches is Test
 Driven Development (TDD). This procedure is based on test cases which
 are incrementally written prior to the implementation. Recently,
 Behavior Driven Development (BDD) has been introduced as an extension of
 TDD, in which natural language scenarios are the starting point for the
 test cases. This description offers a ubiquitous communication mean for
 both the software developers and stakeholders.
 Following the BDD methodology thoroughly, one would expect 100\% code
 coverage, since code is only written to make the test cases pass.
 However, as we show in an empirical study this expectation is not valid
 in practice. It becomes even worse in the process of development, i.e.
 the coverage decreases over time. To close the coverage gap, we sketch
 an algorithm that generates BDD-style scenarios based on uncovered code.}},

 striving to improve their performance, but the methods were originally
 designed for small and individual teams. This creates unique challenges
 when introducing agile at scale, when development teams must synchronize
 their activities, and there might be a need to interface with other
 organizational units. In this paper we present a systematic literature
 review on how agile methods and lean software development has been
 adopted at scale, focusing on reported challenges and success factors in
 the transformation. We conducted a systematic literature review of
 industrial large-scale agile transformations. Our keyword search found
 1875 papers. We included 52 publications describing 42 industrial cases
 presenting the process of taking large-scale agile development into use.
 Almost 90\% of the included papers were experience reports, indicating a
 lack of sound academic research on the topic. We identified 35 reported
 challenges grouped into nine categories, and 29 success factors, grouped
 into eleven categories. The most salient success factor categories were
 management support, choosing and customizing the agile model, training
 and coaching, and mindset and alignment. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

 technologies has developed around projects as the central organisational
 form of software development. A project organisation depends on clear
 bounds regarding scope, participants, development effort and lead-time.
 What happens when these conditions are not given? The article claims
 that this is the case for software product specific ecosystems. As
 software is increasingly developed, adopted and deployed in the form of
 customisable and configurable products, software engineering as a
 discipline needs to take on the challenge to support software
 ecosystems.
 Objective: The article provides a holistic understanding of the observed
 and reported practices as a starting point to device specific support
 for the development in software ecosystems.
 Method: A qualitative interview study was designed based on previous
 long-term ethnographical inspired research.
 Results: The analysis results in a set of common features of product
 development and evolution despite differences in size, kind of software
 and business models. Design is distributed and needs to be coordinated
 across heterogeneous design constituencies that, together with the
 software, build a product specific socio-technical ecosystem. The
 technical design has to support the deference of part of the development
 not only to 3rd-party developers but also to local designers tailoring
 the software in the use organisation. The technical interfaces that
 separate the work of different design constituencies are contested and
 need to be maintained permanently. Development takes place as cycles
 within cycles overlaying development cycles with different rhythms to
 accommodate different evolution drivers.
 Conclusion: The reported practices challenge some of the very core
 assumptions of traditional software engineering, but makes perfect
 sense, considering that the frame of reference for product development
 is not a project but continuous innovation across the respective
 ecosystem. The article provides a number of concrete points for further
 research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

 determine success or failure of entire projects. Although often
 associated with risk or threat, uncertainty bears much overlooked
 qualities regarding market opportunities. Adopting a conceptualization
 of uncertainty that includes both threat and opportunity, we investigate
 different possibilities to manage the uncertainties preceding the
 creation of novel ideas and innovation. In this qualitative study, we
 empirically explore the concept of uncertainty beyond the focus on
 requirement uncertainty that prevails in the literature and explicitly
 emphasize its multidimensionality. We argue that the failure to
 distinguish between different dimensions of uncertainty can lead to
 their inadequate management at high cost. Our results show how teams
 exploit practices to manage different uncertainties in order to mitigate
 threats while remaining open to opportunities. We discuss the
 implications of our findings for product development teams as well as
 for the design of supportive organizational structures.}},

 enterprise software quality management effort. However, little consensus
 exists how enterprise test organizations should be built up and
 structured, especially in connection with continuing penetration of
 recent trends such as enterprise agile development. This position paper
 is built upon our industry experience. During our transformation efforts
 connected with changing a test organization's sourcing arrangement and
 management approach in a large multinational firm, we noticed that
 people tend to prefer one distinct perspective to make sense of
 enterprise test organizations. But such a one-sided approach makes it
 difficult for them to talk to each other about the test organization. To
 illustrate this, we use Gareth Morgan's Images of Organization as an
 analytical lens to discuss three distinct images of test organizations
 we claim people typically carry in their minds. Our work increases
 understanding of design and transformation efforts related to management
 of enterprise software testing.}},

 require less in terms of unit test coverage and automated test packages

 will make the product unique and of high value. However, as the project
 progresses and a horizon appears with capital investors and large
 customer bases, the supporting software process needs to adapt fluidly
 to these evolving requirements. Efficient use of resources, shorter
 release cycles and better levels of quality coverage are a necessity to
 meet stakeholder demands for new features, better features and all to be

 for a more structured definition of what is Agile and what is a
 high-level of Agile maturity. Traditional development methodologies rely
 on documents to record and pass on knowledge from one specialist to the
 next. Feedback cycles are, in many cases, too long or even nonexistent.
 Agile principles emphasize building working software that people can get
 hands on quickly, versus spending a lot of time writing specifications
 up front. Agile development focuses on cross-functional teams empowered
 to make decisions, versus big hierarchies and splitting by function. It
 also focuses on rapid iteration, with continuous customer input along
 the way. This paper deals with Agile methodology and scaling. The
 special highlight is put on people investigating their contribution in
 Agile approach success. Some reflections after using Agile in our own
 organization are also presented.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Objective: Regenstrief Institute developed one of the seminal
 computerized order entry systems, the Medical Gopher, for implementation
 at Wishard Hospital nearly three decades ago. Wishard Hospital and
 Regenstrief remain committed to homegrown software development, and over
 the past 4 years we have fully rebuilt Gopher with an emphasis on
 usability, safety, leveraging open source technologies, and the
 advancement of biomedical informatics research. Our objective in this
 paper is to summarize the functionality of this new system and highlight
 its novel features.
 Materials and methods: Applying a user-centered design process, the new
 Gopher was built upon a rich-internet application framework using an
 agile development process. The system incorporates order entry, clinical
 documentation, result viewing, decision support, and clinical workflow.
 We have customized its use for the outpatient, inpatient, and emergency
 department settings.
 Results: The new Gopher is now in use by over 1100 users a day,
 including an average of 433 physicians caring for over 3600 patients
 daily. The system includes a wizard-like clinical workflow, dynamic
 multimedia alerts, and a familiar e-commerce-based interface for order
 entry. Clinical documentation is enhanced by real-time natural language
 processing and data review is supported by a rapid chart search feature.
 Discussion: As one of the few remaining academically developed order
 entry systems, the Gopher has been designed both to improve patient care
 and to support next-generation informatics research. It has achieved
 rapid adoption within our health system and suggests continued viability
 for homegrown systems in settings of close collaboration between
 developers and providers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

 agile software practices, these practices tend to only affect modules or

 lead-times in launching new or updated products since the overall R\&D

 gate or single cycle V-model.
 This paper identifies challenges for future research on how to combine
 the predictability and planning desired of mechanical manufacturing with
 the dynamic capabilities of modern agile software development. Scaling
 agile in this context requires an expansion in two dimensions: First,
 scaling the number of involved teams. Second, traversing necessary
 systems engineering activities in each sprint due to the co-dependency
 of software and hardware development.}},

 definition agile way to improve the agile way of activities. Besides,
 the challenge of dealing with RE practices is not much is known in agile
 way or model. However, many literature works have been done in RE in
 agile approaches and challenges faced by teamwork. The aim of this paper
 is to fill the gap by presenting RE practices in agile methodology also
 the challenges of RE activities which are faced by agile team members.
 80 systematic literature reviews are conducted and 22 research papers
 are identified. Moreover, the reviews discuss RE in agile methodology
 approaches. This paper has adopted a systematic literature review and
 has applied a certain inclusion and exclusion criteria to detect the
 research studies related to RE in agile methodology to achieve the aim
 of this research. This research determined most of agile requirements
 engineering activities, also challenges of requirements engineering in
 agile methodology. Therefore, the research findings can be a reference
 to all researchers who are interested in this research area because the
 paper's findings clarify that RE in agile methodology need to have
 further attention by researchers and more practical results are needed
 to gain understandable information about RE practices in Agile

  Abstract                 = {{The automotive industry is currently going through an enormous change,
 transitioning from being pure hardware and mechanical companies to
 becoming more software focused. Currently, software development is
 embedded into a V-Model process that defines how software requirements
 are extracted from system requirements. In recent years, OEMs have come
 to recognize the importance and opportunities offered by software, which
 include better management and shorter time-to-market of distinguishing
 features. Strategies to better utilize software include in-house
 software development and new ways to collaborate with suppliers.
 However, in their effort to take advantage of these opportunities,
 engineers struggle with the formal process imposed on software
 development. In this paper, we investigate the impact of this struggle
 on the flow of requirements, including challenges and practices. We
 found that new ways of working with requirements had emerged that are
 partly not supported, partly hindered by the old tooling and processes
 for requirements engineering. Requirements flow both vertical and
 horizontal in the organization and across the supply-chain. Support for
 the new way of working should allow us to refine requirements
 iteratively throughout their life-cycle, handle the discussion of
 rationales, and to manage assumptions. We found strategies of achieving
 this to differ not only between OEMs, but also between different
 divisions inside the OEMs.}},

 This paper examines the preconditions for setting up an experimentation
 system for continuous customer experiments. It describes the RIGHT model
 for Continuous Experimentation (Rapid Iterative value creation Gained
 through High-frequency Testing), illustrating the building blocks
 required for such a system. Method: An initial model for continuous
 experimentation is analytically derived from prior work. The model is
 matched against empirical case study findings from two startup companies
 and further developed. Results: Building blocks for a continuous
 experimentation system and infrastructure are presented. Conclusions: A
 suitable experimentation system requires at least the ability to release
 minimum viable products or features with suitable instrumentation,
 design and manage experiment plans, link experiment results with a
 product roadmap, and manage a flexible business strategy. The main
 challenges are proper, rapid design of experiments, advanced
 instrumentation of software to collect, analyse, and store relevant
 data, and the integration of experiment results in both the product
 development cycle and the software development process. (C) 2016

  Abstract                 = {{Cloud computing is among the most discussed issues in the information
 communication and technology (ICT) sector. Information technology (IT)
 infrastructure is altered by the business methods due to cloud computing
 and moved ahead towards a utility model of `pay as you go'. Instead of
 spending time with constructing, managing, maintaining and running their
 own physical infrastructure, now firms can host their applications,
 platforms and storage in data centers on virtual servers supported by
 professional third parties. Such services based out of the `cloud'
 assist agile and cost efficient business surroundings. The most
 essential economic influence of cloud technology could exist in
 developed competitiveness and cost savings of existing IT services, as
 well as in introducing new services to private and public companies.
 Because of the bulk buying of hardware and processing power, demand
 aggregation, and decreased costs of labor per unit, cloud providers can
 achieve essential savings on their running price and pass these on to
 their customers. Businesses can utilize the cloud computing
 technologies, thereby using better equipment with more flexibility,
 being faster, and having lower expenditures of capital. Customers of
 cloud computing technologies make data an online content interactive and
 accessible for users. Given the importance of cloud computing, not many
 studies have been conducted from the adoption perspective and, in
 particular, have not sought to identify factors of risk in the most

 program modifications are correct. Though substantial research results
 on test selection techniques have been reported in the literature, very
 few software industries deploy systematic test selection strategies or
 automation support. The expert judgment is the most often used in the
 industry for identification of relevant cases for re-testing that is
 usually difficult and inefficient. This paper introduces an agile
 strategy that divides a test suite with Equivalence Classification
 Partition (ECP) into sub-domains. The subset selected from the
 sub-domains provides a complete and comprehensive coverage of test
 criteria. The ECP is expressed with Classification Tree Method (CTM) and
 easy to be adjusted for different goals flexibly, e.g., re-test for
 modified function, delivery deadline or human resource limit. Our method
 is implemented as a tool and evaluated on two projects experimentally.
 The results demonstrated that this method can improve the efficiency and
 effectiveness of re-testing greatly.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The crowdsourcing, as a service pattern in cloud environment, usually
 aims at the cross-disciplinary cooperation and creating value together
 with customers and becomes increasingly prevalent. Software process, as
 a kind of software development and management strategy, is defined as a
 series of activities implemented by software life cycle and provides a
 set of rules for various phases of the software engineering to achieve
 the desired objectives. With the current software development cycle
 getting shorter, facing more frequent needs change and fierce
 competition, a new resource management pattern is proposed to respond to
 these issues agilely by introducing the crowdsourcing service to agile
 software development for pushing the agility of software process. Then,
 a user-oriented resource scheduling method is proposed for rational use
 of various resources in the process and maximizing the benefits of all
 parties. From the experimental results, the proposed pattern and
 resources scheduling method reduces greatly the resource of project
 resource manager and increases the team resource utilization rate, which
 greatly improves the agility of software process and delivers software
 products quickly in crowdsourcing pattern.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The CERN IT department has built over the years a performant and
 integrated ecosystem of collaboration tools, from videoconference and
 webcast services to event management software. These services have been
 designed and evolved in very close collaboration with the various
 communities surrounding the laboratory and have been massively adopted
 by CERN users. To cope with this very heavy usage, global
 infrastructures have been deployed which take full advantage of CERN's
 international and global nature. If these services and tools are
 instrumental in enabling the worldwide collaboration which generates
 major HEP breakthroughs, they would certainly also benefit other sectors
 of science in which globalization has already taken place. Some of these
 services are driven by commercial software (Vidyo or Wowza for example),
 some others have been developed internally and have already been made
 available to the world as Open Source Software in line with CERN's
 spirit and mission. Indico for example is now installed in 100+
 institutes worldwide. But providing the software is often not enough and
 institutes, collaborations and project teams do not always possess the
 expertise, or human or material resources that are needed to set up and
 maintain such services. Regional and national institutions have to
 answer needs, which are growingly global and often contradict their
 operational capabilities or organizational mandate and so are looking at
 existing worldwide service offers such as CERN's. We believe that the
 accumulated experience obtained through the operation of a large scale
 worldwide collaboration service combined with CERN's global network and
 its recently-deployed Agile Infrastructure would allow the Organization
 to set up and operate collaborative services, such as Indico and Vidyo,
 at a much larger scale and on behalf of worldwide research and education
 institutions and thus answer these pressing demands while optimizing
 resources at a global level. Such services would be built over a robust
 and massively scalable Indico server to which the concept of communities
 would be added, and which would then serve as a hub for accessing other
 collaboration services such as Vidyo, on the same simple and successful
 model currently in place for CERN users. This talk will describe this
 vision, its benefits and the steps that have already been taken to make
 it come to life.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The process that involves creating and altering software systems can be
 defined as the software development lifecycle. People often use
 methodologies and methods in order to develop these systems with success
 factors such as people, processes and technology.
 The underlying issue in such a Iifecycle is that project defects are
 identified late within the lifecycle and therefore, the process of
 rectifying these problems becomes costly. Ultimately, an ideal product
 is one with minimal or zero defects, which can be achieved with a
 software project that prevents or detects defects earlier within the
 cycle.
 Release management can be described as the process involving
 decision-making regarding the implementation and release of a software
 product. A conceptual framework exists, which stipulates the stages
 involved in the development process of a software application. Several
 models exist that describe the software development Iifecycle (SDLC) in
 different approaches. The purpose of the research presented in this
 paper is to incorporate findings where large companies with global IT
 projects can adopt the Agile conceptual framework and to testify whether
 all types of IT projects will benefit from a frequent release approach
 to the delivery of the project. Three different projects across a large
 South African financial institution that specialises in corporate
 organisation banking and core-banking functionality will be studied and
 presented as case studies. Release management will also be studied from
 an organisational perspective with one of South Africa's banking
 institution in context. Data will be retrieved by carrying out
 interviews and surveys with appropriate stakeholders, and therefore,
 analysed to generate a valid conclusion.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Throughout its short history, software development has been
 characterized by harmful disconnects between important activities such
 as planning, development and implementation. The problem is further
 exacerbated by the episodic and infrequent performance of activities
 such as planning, testing, integration and releases. Several emerging
 phenomena reflect attempts to address these problems. For example,
 Continuous Integration is a practice which has emerged to eliminate
 discontinuities between development and deployment. In a similar vein,
 the recent emphasis on DevOps recognizes that the integration between
 software development and its operational deployment needs to be a
 continuous one. We argue a similar continuity is required between
 business strategy and development, BizDev being the term we coin for
 this. These disconnects are even more problematic given the need for
 reliability and resilience in the complex and data-intensive systems
 being developed today. We identify a number of continuous activities
 which together we label as `Continuous {*}' (i.e. Continuous Star) which
 we present as part of an overall roadmap for Continuous Software
 engineering. We argue for a continuous (but not necessarily rapid)
 software engineering delivery pipeline. We conclude the paper with a
 research agenda. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The dynamic behaviour of epithelial cell sheets plays a central role
 during development, growth, disease and wound healing. These processes
 occur as a result of cell adhesion, migration, division, differentiation
 and death, and involve multiple processes acting at the cellular and
 molecular level. Computational models offer a useful means by which to
 investigate and test hypotheses about these processes, and have played a
 key role in the study of cell cell interactions. However, the
 necessarily complex nature of such models means that it is difficult to
 make accurate comparison between different models, since it is often
 impossible to distinguish between differences in behaviour that are due
 to the underlying model assumptions, and those due to differences in the
 in silico implementation of the model. In this work, an approach is
 described for the implementation of vertex dynamics models, a discrete
 approach that represents each cell by a polygon (or polyhedron) whose
 vertices may move in response to forces. The implementation is
 undertaken in a consistent manner within a single open source
 computational framework, Chaste, which comprises fully tested,
 industrial-grade software that has been developed using an agile
 approach. This framework allows one to easily change assumptions
 regarding force generation and cell rearrangement processes within these
 models. The versatility and generality of this framework is illustrated
 using a number of biological examples. In each case we provide full
 details of all technical aspects of our model implementations, and in
 some cases provide extensions to make the models more generally
 applicable. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

 traditional software engineering methodologies. However, despite the
 advantages of using agile methodologies, the transition between

 several problems associated with the use of agile methodologies.
 Examples of these problems are related to (i) lack of metrics to measure
 the amount of rework that occurs per sprint, (ii) interruption of a
 project after several iterations, (iii) changes in the requirements,
 (iv) lack of documentation, and (v) lack of management control. In this
 paper we present Trace++, a traceability technique that extends
 traditional traceability relationships with extra information in order
 to support the transition between traditional and agile software
 development. The use of Trace++ has been evaluated in two real projects
 of different software development companies to measure the benefits of
 using Trace++ to support agile software development.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The Agile Software Development (ASD) process is at the forefront of
 rapid product development driven by changing customer requirements and a
 trusted, self-organizing development team. Scrum has become a viable
 model of ASD focusing on determining immediate deliverables and
 structuring short timelines, called Sprints, for designing,
 implementing, and providing them for testing by the customer. While
 these practices are being adopted by organizations, there is significant
 difficulty in scaling them to the classroom. Once in place, it is a
 complex task to evaluate individual student performance based solely on
 the product outcome and Sprint grade. Thus, there is limited opportunity
 to catch performance problems that may lead to missing deliverable
 deadlines or decreasing team trust. In this paper, we impose ASD using
 Scrum on a senior software projects course in Computer Science. Using a
 collaborative environment that embeds a social network, project
 management modules, and event capture system, we perform broad data and
 event capture and analysis to investigate metrics that are relevant to
 assessing individual performance aspects related to functioning on an
 Agile team for software development. Our results suggest that predictive
 data is available after each Sprint to ascertain individual performance
 attributes and their relationship to product outcomes.}},

 engineering approaches. Validation of model transformations is crucial
 for the quality assurance of software systems to be constructed. The
 relational logic based specification language Alloy and its accompanying
 tool the Alloy Analyzer have been used in the past to validate
 properties of model transformations. However Alloy based analysis of
 transformations suffers from time complexity and scalability issues. The
 problem becomes even more severe when it comes to higher order
 transformations that are inherently more complex. In previous work, we
 proposed a sub-language of Alloy, called F-Alloy, that is tailored for
 model transformation specifications. Instead of pure analysis based
 validation, F-Alloy speeds up the validation of model transformations by
 applying a hybrid strategy that combines analysis with interpretation.
 In this paper, we show how the F-Alloy approach can be extended to also
 support efficient validation of higher order transformations.}},

 Results: This research discovered that inadequate and dysfunctional
 training was one of the critical issues that affected Agile
 transformation process. This study shows that comprehensive and
 functional training is not often provided to support Agile
 transformation. This paper shows the primary causes of inadequate and
 dysfunctional training, its adverse consequences on the transformation
 process, and the heuristic and ad-hoc treatments as the strategies used

 Conclusion: Comprehensive training is important in Agile transformation
 process. Inadequate and dysfunctional training causes several challenges
 and problems for software companies and development teams when moving to
 Agile. Several ad-hoc strategies identified by this study can be
 employed to help software teams and companies facing similar problems.

 of interest many issues remain unaddressed. In this paper we address
 both team member communication and the combination of project and
 product development. One of the main conclusions is that communication
 can be improved if tool infrastructure combine different levels of
 information (i.e. team members, project status and product status). The
 use of simple tools, such as Vsee in SmartBoards is useful for reducing
 distance between sites. Dependency on bandwidth is not a new issue but
 is still relevant.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In recent years, there has been an on-going demand for better services
 and functionality in software products; as a consequence many models,
 techniques, and tools have been developed such as CMMI-DEV v1.2, TSP, or
 Scrum. However, software products still suffer from excessive costs,
 delays in delivery, and low quality. Furthermore, there is a lack of
 educational material providing high levels of interaction between
 students and the software industry to learn about how enterprises adopt
 these models, techniques, and tools into their daily work. This article
 describes a web-based Tool (EduSysProVAL) to support a graduate course
 in collaboration with the local software industry. The main goal of this
 research is to demonstrate that a Software Engineering course may use
 the EduSysProVAL tool to improve students' practical and professional
 skills, thus increasing their participation and effort in improvement
 initiatives, in comparison to traditional educational approaches which
 are only based on theory classes. This research uses a four-category
 questionnaire and follow-up interviews to evaluate a satisfactory level
 of tool effectiveness with undergraduate students and summarizes the
 industry's positive perceptions about its contribution to the course.

 undergraduate, project-oriented education. This model brings faculty,
 students, and community partners together to investigate an open-ended
 academic question, and their collaboration yields an original product
 that represents their inquiry. The academic studio integrates agile
 software development practice, project-oriented pedagogy, and
 sociocultural cognition theories. Scrum provides the framework in which
 self-organizing, cross-functional teams define their methodology, and
 Scrum practices facilitate assessment of student learning outcomes.
 This model emerged from design-based research across six studio
 instances, each of which investigated the relationship of fun, games,
 and learning through the development of educational video games. Formal
 and informal analysis of these instances gives rise to several themes,
 including the importance of a formalized process to encourage learning
 and productivity, the critical role of an expert faculty mentor, the
 need to combine academic and industrial practice to manage the inherent
 challenges of collaborative software development, and the unique
 characteristics of learning outcomes arising from this model. We
 conclude that the academic studio model is beneficial to student
 learning and faculty development, and we encourage the adoption,
 adaptation, and evaluation of the model.}},

 mapping between a system requirement and its implementation in the

 modifications without losing previous versions of the model, and finally

 Chains of diverse VNFs delivered to large scale customers. To describe
 network resources, network control functions and VNFs capabilities we
 introduced an Information Model that abstracts these elements. In order
 to verify the proposed architecture we considered the case of multiple
 Content Delivery Network (CDN) providers having CDN caching nodes hosted
 by another operator. We implemented and deployed VNFs capable to map
 virtual links on the physical substrate and monitor the traffic of each
 client, ultimately providing the means to instantiate and orchestrate a

 through an experience report about developing a tool-suite prototype for
 an MDE approach for the process control domain that is capable of
 supporting the development of real-life process control software. Before
 the work presented in this paper an initial prototype tool suite was
 already developed. However, it was not able to adequately support
 industry-scale projects. The paper starts with an analysis of the past
 development of this already-existing laboratory prototype and then moves
 on to a report about the development of the industrial prototype, which
 is influenced by the findings of the analysis. Then a comparison between
 the two prototypes is made and the lessons learned are described, which
 may be useful to practitioners who attempt to develop support tools for
 an MDE approach that are useful in practice. The most important lesson
 learned is that when developing tool support for complex modeling
 languages, the traditional development approach should not be easily
 rejected.}},

 useful theoretical constructs that will help researchers and

 uncover four factors that are critical in this development processes,
 namely: project uncertainty profile and project completion urgency; IT
 project team capabilities; organizational control mechanisms; and trust
 relationships among the IT project team, the vendors, and the users.
 Depending on the unpredictable nature of the project and the trust level
 among the IT project team, the vendors, and the users, we have uncovered
 the IT project team capabilities and the organizational control
 mechanisms that are needed to assure the success of a large-scale IT
 project. We posit that the interplay between the IT project team
 capabilities and the trust-mediated organizational control mechanisms
 forms the theoretical basis that defines agile IS development practice
 in large-scale IT projects. We argue that our findings provide insights
 to practitioners who are attempting to introduce agile IS development
 practices into any large-scale IT project. From a research perspective,
 the theory developed in this paper also sheds light on the importance of

 being developed. While modern software development methodologies such as
 Agile and Dev-Ops suggest. different ways of assuring code quality, very
 little attention is paid to maintaining high quality of the architecture
 of the evolving systems. By detecting and alerting about violations of
 the intended software architecture, one can often avoid code-level bad
 smells such as spaghetti code.
 Typically, if one wants to reason about the software architecture, the
 burden of first defining the intended architecture falls on the
 developer's shoulders. This includes definition of valid and invalid
 dependencies between software components. However, the developers are
 seldom familiar with the entire software system, which makes this task
 difficult, time consuming and error-prone.
 We propose and implement a solution for automatic detection of
 architectural violations in software artifacts. The solution, which
 utilizes a number of predefined and user-defined patterns, does not
 require prior knowledge of the system or its intended architecture. We
 propose to leverage this solution as part of the nightly build process
 used by development teams, thus achieving continuous automatic
 validation of the system's software architecture. As we show in multiple
 open-source and proprietary cases, a small set of predefined patterns
 can detect architectural violations as they are introduced over the
 course of development, and also capture deterioration in existing
 architectural problems. By evaluating the tool on relatively large
 open-source projects, we also validate its scalability and practical
 applicability to large software systems.}},

 achieve this through the adoption of agile practices in software release
 practices. Problem: There is no secondary study in the literature
 discussing evidences of the influence of agile approaches in OSS
 projects release practices. Goal: Identify published reports in the
 literature that characterize to which extent agility has influenced
 release approaches in OSS projects. Method: The characterization of
 studies followed a five-phase process to present a panoramic view of
 software releases practices in the context of OSS projects. Results: The
 overall data collected from 14 studies published from January 2006 to
 January 2016 depicted the following scenario: nine issues that
 characterize the advantages/influence of agility in OSS release
 approaches; four challenge issues in this approach; three possibilities
 of implementation and two main motivations towards the adoption of
 software release approaches through agility; and finally three main
 strategies to implement it. Conclusion: This study provides an
 up-to-date and structured understanding of the influence of agility on
 OSS projects release approaches based on findings systematically
 collected from a list of relevant references in the last decade.}},

 inception. However, identifying whether a development method is in
 accordance with the agile philosophy has become a challenge because of
 the diversity and amount of their activities, artifacts and roles. Thus,
 we defined the AgilAC framework to support agility analysis of
 development methods. It supports software engineers to better understand
 the adherence of their methods to agile philosophy. In order to evaluate
 the applicability of this framework, an experiment was conducted to
 comparing the AgilAC and the ad hoc analysis, and it is presented in
 this paper. We adopted two criteria in the comparison: the time spent
 during the analysis and the correctness of the analysis result. We
 observed that although the AgilAC requires more time to be applied than
 the ad hoc analysis, the quality of the analysis results were better.
 Therefore, it was possible to verify the advantage of the AgilAC over an
 ad hoc analysis, when considering the correctness of the agility
 characterization.}},

 octaves, which need to be supported in form-factor and energy
 constrained mobile devices targeting ubiquitous connectivity. However,
 in current multi-band radio implementations, significant redundancy is
 still the norm in the RF frontend. This work introduces an improved
 architecture for multi-band, time-division duplexed (TDD) radios, which
 replaces multiple narrowband frontend components with a frequency-agile
 solution, tunable over a wide frequency range. A highly digital
 architecture is adopted, leading to a fully integrated solution wherein
 both efficiency and achievable frequency range benefit from CMOS
 scaling. A prototype is integrated in 45 nm SOI CMOS. Peak PA output
 power is 27.7 +/- 0.5 dBm from 1.3 to 3.3 GHz, with up to 30\% total
 efficiency at 2 V. For TDD LTE applications, better than -30 dBc ACLR
 and -30 dB EVM is measured with 64 QAM, 20 MHz signals from 1.44 to 3.41
 GHz, with up to 17.2\% average efficiency and 23.4 dBm average power.
 The LNA achieves A(v) >= 14 dB, NF = 4.4 +/- 1.6 dB and IIP3 >= -7 dBm
 from 1.3 to 3.3 GHz while drawing just 6 mA from 1 V. The demonstrated
 frequency range covers a total of 11 TDD bands.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Context: The planning, estimation and controlling mechanisms of agile
 process models rely significantly on a fixed set of tasks being
 established for each sprint. These tasks are created as refinements of
 product backlog items at the beginning of each sprint. However, a
 project team's understanding of the backlog items' business implications
 and dependencies may often not be deep enough to identify all necessary
 tasks this early, so in addition to the tasks defined in the beginning
 of the sprint, more necessary tasks might be discovered as the sprint
 progresses, making any attempt at progress estimation or risk management
 difficult.
 Objective: We strive to enable software teams to achieve a deeper
 understanding of product backlog items, which should help them to
 identify a sprint's tasks more reliably and comprehensively, and avoid
 discovering the need for extra tasks during sprint execution.
 Method: We introduced a project team in a medium-sized software
 development company to the Interaction Room method, which encourages
 interdisciplinary communication about key system design aspects among
 all stakeholders. We observed the team's conduct in the sprint planning
 meetings, and tracked early- vs. late-identified tasks across several
 sprints.
 Results: Before the introduction of our method, the team used to
 discover on average 26\% of a sprint's tasks not at the beginning of the
 sprint, but later during the course of the sprint. Using the Interaction
 Room in two separate projects, this ratio dropped to an average of 5\%
 late-discovered tasks.
 Conclusion: Our observations from these projects suggest that increased
 communication among all stakeholders of a project leads to a more
 reliable identification of the tasks to be performed in a sprint, and
 that an Interaction Room can provide appropriate guidance to conduct
 this team communication in a focused and pragmatic way. (C) 2015

  Abstract                 = {{Objective Electronic medical records (EMRs) are being increasingly
 utilized to conduct clinical and epidemiologic research in numerous
 fields. To monitor and improve care of HIV-infected patients in
 Washington, DC, one of the most severely affected urban areas in the
 United States, we developed a city-wide database across 13 clinical
 sites using electronic data abstraction and manual data entry from EMRs.
 Materials and Methods To develop this unique longitudinal cohort, a
 web-based electronic data capture system (Discovere (R)) was used. An
 Agile software development methodology was implemented across multiple
 EMR platforms. Clinical informatics staff worked with information
 technology specialists from each site to abstract data electronically
 from each respective site's EMR through an extract, transform, and load
 process.
 Results Since enrollment began in 2011, more than 7000 patients have
 been enrolled, with longitudinal clinical data available on all
 patients. Data sets are produced for scientific analyses on a quarterly
 basis, and benchmarking reports are generated semi-annually enabling
 each site to compare their participants' clinical status, treatments,
 and outcomes to the aggregated summaries from all other sites.
 Discussion Numerous technical challenges were identified and innovative
 solutions developed to ensure the successful implementation of the DC
 Cohort. Central to the success of this project was the broad
 collaboration established between government, academia, clinics,
 community, information technology staff, and the patients themselves.
 Conclusions Our experiences may have practical implications for
 researchers who seek to merge data from diverse clinical databases, and
 are applicable to the study of health-related issues beyond HIV.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Context: There continues to be concern that research is not addressing
 the challenges that practice faces. For the benefit of academia and
 industry, researchers need to be aware of practitioners' challenges and
 their context so that relevant and applicable research is undertaken.
 Objective: This paper investigates two research questions: what
 challenges do agile, practitioners face? and, how do practitioner
 challenges manifest themselves in an organisational setting? It aims to
 map the practitioner challenge landscape, explore challenge
 characteristics, compare findings with previous literature and identify
 implications for research that is relevant to practice.
 Method: A combination of methods was used: elicitation of practitioner
 challenges collected using a Challenge Wall at a series of practitioner
 events; organisational case study using interviews, document analysis
 and observation; and online survey. Findings were then compared to
 previous publications.
 Results: Challenges collected from the Challenge Wall were grouped under
 27 subthemes and seven themes: claims and limitations, organisation,
 sustainability, culture, teams, scale, and value. Investigating one
 challenge in the case study uncovered a set of new challenges, which
 were inter-related. Over 50\% of survey respondents experienced
 challenges highlighted in the case study.
 Conclusion: The landscape of agile practitioner challenges is complex
 and intertwined. Some challenges, such as doing agile in a non-agile
 environment, are multi-dimensional, affect many aspects of practice, and
 may be experienced simultaneously as business, organisational, social
 and adaptation problems. Some challenges, such as understanding cultural
 change or measuring agile value, persist and are hard to address, while
 others, such as adoption, change focus over time. Some challenges, such
 as governance and contracts, are under-researched, While others, such as
 business and IT transformation, have been researched but findings{''}
 have not had the expected impact. Researchers wishing to address
 practitioner challenges need to treat them in context rather than in
 isolation and improve knowledge transfer. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

  Abstract                 = {{We report an action research-oriented approach to investigating agile
 project management methods which aims to bridge the gap between academic
 research and agile practice. We have set up a research network of
 academics from two universities, through which we run focussed
 project-based research into agile methods. Organisations are invited to
 suggest an `agile challenge' and we work closely with them to
 investigate how challenge affects them. Our approach is both academic
 and practical. We use appropriate research methods such as interviews,
 observation and discussion to clarify and explore the nature of the
 challenge. We then undertake a detailed literature review to identify
 practical approaches that may be appropriate for adoption, and report
 our findings. If the organisation introduces new practices or approaches
 as a result of our work, we conduct an academic evaluation.
 Alternatively, if we uncover an under-researched area, we propose
 undertaking some basic research. As befits the topic, we work
 iteratively and incrementally and produce regular outputs. In this paper
 we introduce our approach, overview research methods used in the agile
 research literature, describe our research model, outline a case study,
 and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of our approach. We discuss
 the importance of producing outputs that are accessible to practitioners
 as well as researchers. Findings suggest that by investigating the
 challenges that organisations propose, we uncover problems that are of
 real relevance to the agile community and obtain rich insights into the
 facilitators and barriers that organisations face when using agile
 methods. Additionally, we find that practitioners are interested in
 research results as long as publications are relevant to their needs and
 are written accessibly. We are satisfied with the basic structure of our
 approach, but we anticipate that the method will evolve as we continue
 to work with collaborators.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The agile approach to projects focuses more on close-knit teams than
 traditional waterfall projects, which means that aspects of group
 maturity become even more important. This psychological aspect is not
 much researched in connection to the building of an ``agile team.{''}
 The purpose of this study is to investigate how building agile teams is
 connected to a group development model taken from social psychology. We
 conducted ten semi-structured interviews with coaches, Scrum Masters,
 and managers responsible for the agile process from seven different
 companies, and collected survey data from 66 group-members from four
 companies (a total of eight different companies). The survey included an
 agile measurement tool and the one part of the Group Development
 Questionnaire. The results show that the practitioners define group
 developmental aspects as key factors to a successful agile transition.
 Also, the quantitative measurement of agility was significantly
 correlated to the group maturity measurement. We conclude that adding
 these psychological aspects to the description of the ``agile team{''}
 could increase the understanding of agility and partly help define an
 ``agile team.{''} We propose that future work should develop specific
 guidelines for how software development teams at different maturity
 levels might adopt agile principles and practices differently. (C) 2016

 methods, and the data were collected via an online survey. The selected
 Agility measurement was correlated to a Group Development measurement
 and showed significant convergent validity, i.e., a more mature team is
 also a more agile team. This means that the agile methods probably would
 benefit from taking group development into account when its practices

 structure. This case study was conducted at a car manufacturer in
 Sweden, consisting of an unstructured interview with the Scrum Master
 and a semi-structured focus group. The results show that the teams felt
 that the feedback from the surrounding organization was unsynchronized
 resulting in them not feeling appreciated when delivering their work.
 Moreover, they felt frustrated when working on non-agile teams after
 have been working on agile ones. This study concludes that there were
 work motivational affects of fitting an agile team into a non-agile
 surrounding organization, and therefore this might also be true for
 other organizations.}},

 think of secure network without using firewall. Already layer 2 and

  Abstract                 = {{LOFAR, the LOw-Frequency ARray, is a new-generation radio interferometer
 constructed in the north of the Netherlands and across europe. Utilizing
 a novel phased-array design, LOFAR covers the largely unexplored
 low-frequency range from 10-240 MHz and provides a number of unique
 observing capabilities. Spreading out from a core located near the
 village of Exloo in the northeast of the Netherlands, a total of 40
 LOFAR stations are nearing completion. A further five stations have been
 deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been built in each of
 France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques make the
 LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as
 well as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its
 dense core array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves
 unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency
 radio regime. The LOFAR facilities are jointly operated by the
 International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) foundation, as an observatory open
 to the global astronomical community. LOFAR is one of the first radio
 observatories to feature automated processing pipelines to deliver fully
 calibrated science products to its user community. LOFAR's new
 capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important

 appropriately describe different specific system aspects. To this end,
 efficient integration of different heterogeneous modeling languages is
 essential. Modeling language integaration is onerous and requires
 in-depth conceptual and technical knowledge and effort. Traditional
 modeling lanugage integration approches require language engineers to
 compose monolithic language aggregates for a specific task or project.
 Adapting these aggregates to different contexts requires vast effort and
 makes these hardly reusable. This contribution presents a method for the
 engineering of grammar-based language components that can be
 independently developed, are syntactically composable, and ultimately
 reusable. To this end, it introduces the concepts of language
 aggregation, language embedding, and language inheritance, as well as
 their realization in the language workbench MontiCore. The result is a
 generalizable, systematic, and efficient syntax-oriented composition of
 languages that allows the agile employment of modeling languages
 efficiently tailored for individual software projects.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Network programmability has re-emerged as a top item of the networking
 research agenda since Software Defined Networking (SDN) gained wide
 acceptance simultaneously in vendor product line plans and operator
 expectations for future deployments. Key ingredients for the successful
 deployment of SDN technologies are standardized models, mechanisms, and
 protocols for the separation of the control and forwarding planes. The
 Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standardization effort on
 Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) has published a set
 of standards track documents which specify in detail a comprehensive
 architectural framework and the respective standard protocols which can
 be employed to implement the separation of these two planes in a
 flexible, scalable, and vendor-agnostic yet fully interoperable manner.
 The IETF standards on ForCES define how to achieve said separation
 through a complete and modular system model of the forwarding plane
 elements. In the ForCES model every network element is composed of
 numerous logically separate and well-defined functional entities that
 cooperate to provide the desired overall functionality, such as a
 routing or IP switching. The elegance of the model lies in the fact that
 a ForCES-based implementation of a network element is indistinguishable
 from a traditional ({''}closed-box{''}) network element and therefore
 can be deployed in the field without any need for migration to a new
 architecture. Conversely, ForCES allows for rapid prototyping and agile
 deployment of new architectures as emphasis is placed on
 software-defined functionality and full programmability. The difference
 of ForCES from other SDN approaches that depend on logically centralized
 controllers and the deployment of solely simple or ``dumb{''} switches
 is that ForCES standards provide a complete toolbox to design,
 implement, and interoperate ForCES-based network elements with both
 previously deployed infrastructures as well as in experimental or
 early-deployment phase endeavors. An example of the former is the
 implementation of 3GPP-standardized network elements such as a packet
 gateway (PGW). Examples of the latter include the use of ForCES for
 network function virtualization (NFV) proofs-of-concepts. This paper
 surveys the programmable networks and SDN area and provides a
 comprehensive tutorial on ForCES by summarizing numerous standards
 documents and thus making the technology easily understood by the wider
 research community. We present the design goals, choices, and tradeoffs
 for this standardized approach for network programmability and provide a
 thorough primer on the ForCES model and protocol. This paper also
 surveys recent independent interoperable implementations that showcase
 the full spectrum of ForCES applications in the era of NFV and SDN.}},

 software quality and the second is the agile practices of continuous
 integration. Software quality has been an important topic since the
 beginning of the software development and production. Many researches
 have been conducted to discuss how the quality of software is a critical
 factor to its success {[}1,2,3,4,5]. Because software became an
 important part of almost every task in our daily life, having high
 quality software that meets the users' expectations is important
 {[}6].Software integration is a stage in every software development
 lifecycle, it is defined as the process to assemble the software
 components and produce a single product. It has been shown that software
 integration and integration testing can make more than 40\% of the
 overall project cost, so it is important that they are done efficiently
 and easily to be able to manage the involved risks {[}7]. A software
 engineering practice called continuous integration (CI) was introduced
 by Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries to mitigate the risks of software
 integration, enhance its process and improve its quality {[}8]. In this
 research, the principles of CI are identified and applied to a case
 study in order to analyze their impact on the software development
 process quality factors. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

  Abstract                 = {{Story Point is a relative measure heavily used for agile estimation of
 size. The team decides how big a point is, and based on that size,
 determines how many points each work item is. In many organizations, the
 use of story points for similar features can vary from team to another,
 and successfully, based on the teams' sizes, skillset and relative use
 of this tool. But in a CMMI organization, this technique demands a
 degree of consistency across teams for a more streamlined approach to
 solution delivery. This generates a challenge for CMMI organizations to
 adopt Agile in software estimation and planning. In this paper, a
 process and methodology that guarantees relativity in software sizing
 while using agile story points is introduced. The proposed process and
 methodology are applied in a CMMI company level three on different
 projects. By that, the story point is used on the level of the
 organization, not the project. Then, the performance of sizing process
 is measured to show a significant improvement in sizing accuracy after
 adopting the agile story point in CMMI organizations. To complete the
 estimation cycle, an improvement in effort estimation dependent on story
 point is also introduced, and its performance effect is measured.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm to address the
 demands for flexible and agile network controllability. The fundamental
 idea of SDN is the physical separation of the network control plane from
 the data (forwarding) plane. This migration of control into programmable
 computing devices enables the underlying network infrastructures to be
 abstracted for applications and services. It brings many beneficial
 features such as programmability, agility, elasticity. Currently,
 OpenFlow is widely used as interfacing protocol between data and control
 planes. However, to practically deploy the SDN paradigm, OpenFlow is
 insufficient in terms of scalability, performance, heterogeneity,
 inter-operability with legacy networks and protocols. To overcome those
 limitations, we need to consider multiple protocols as South Bound
 Interface for SDN controllers. In this paper, we describe our experience
 to design and implement Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) in
 ONOS, which is an open source SDN OS for service providers. LISP is a
 tunneling based protocol to solve Internet scalability issue, and
 several recent studies show that LISP can be applied to various use
 cases to improve efficiency such as virtual machine live migration,
 multi-homing, and traffic engineering. Therefore, LISP is a good
 candidate to extend SDN's South Bound Interface. Furthermore, several
 use cases to effectively use LISP within SDN environments are
 introduced.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Background: A convergence of high-throughput sequencing and
 computational power is transforming biology into information science.
 Despite these technological advances, converting bits and bytes of
 sequence information into meaningful insights remains a challenging
 enterprise. Biological systems operate on multiple hierarchical levels
 from genomes to biomes. Holistic understanding of biological systems
 requires agile software tools that permit comparative analyses across
 multiple information levels (DNA, RNA, protein, and metabolites) to
 identify emergent properties, diagnose system states, or predict
 responses to environmental change.
 Results: Here we adopt the MetaPathways annotation and analysis pipeline
 and Pathway Tools to construct environmental pathway/genome databases
 (ePGDBs) that describe microbial community metabolism using MetaCyc, a
 highly curated database of metabolic pathways and components covering
 all domains of life. We evaluate Pathway Tools' performance on three
 datasets with different complexity and coding potential, including
 simulated metagenomes, a symbiotic system, and the Hawaii Ocean
 Time-series. We define accuracy and sensitivity relationships between
 read length, coverage and pathway recovery and evaluate the impact of
 taxonomic pruning on ePGDB construction and interpretation. Resulting
 ePGDBs provide interactive metabolic maps, predict emergent metabolic
 pathways associated with biosynthesis and energy production and
 differentiate between genomic potential and phenotypic expression across
 defined environmental gradients.
 Conclusions: This multi-tiered analysis provides the user community with
 specific operating guidelines, performance metrics and prediction
 hazards for more reliable ePGDB construction and interpretation.
 Moreover, it demonstrates the power of Pathway Tools in predicting
 metabolic interactions in natural and engineered ecosystems.}},

 one using Traditional Scrum and the other using Targeted Scrum. We then
 assessed how well both methodologies assisted the software development
 teams in planning and developing the software architecture, prioritizing
 requirements, and communicating progress. We also evaluated the software
 product produced by both methodologies. We found that Targeted Scrum did
 better in assisting the software development teams in the planning and
 prioritization of the requirements. However, Targeted Scrum had a

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Scientists have become increasingly reliant on software in
 order to perform research that is too time-intensive, expensive, or
 dangerous to perform physically. Because the results produced by the
 software drive important decisions, the software must be correct and
 developed efficiently. Various software engineering practices have been
 shown to increase correctness and efficiency in the development of
 traditional software. It is unclear whether these observations will hold
 in a scientific context.
 Objective: This paper evaluates claims from software engineers and
 scientific software developers about 12 different software engineering
 practices and their use in developing scientific software.
 Method: We performed a systematic literature review examining claims
 about how scientists develop software. Of the 189 papers originally
 identified, 43 are included in the literature review. These 43 papers
 contain 33 different claims about 12 software engineering practices.
 Results: The majority of the claims indicated that software engineering
 practices are useful for scientific software development. Every claim
 was supported by evidence (i.e. personal experience, interview/survey,
 or case study) with slightly over half supported by multiple forms of
 evidence. For those claims supported by only one type of evidence,
 interviews/surveys were the most common. The claims that received the
 most support were: ``The effectiveness of the testing practices
 currently used by scientific software developers is limited{''} and
 ``Version control software is necessary for research groups with more
 than one developer.{''} Additionally, many scientific software
 developers have unconsciously adopted an agile-like development
 methodology.
 Conclusion: Use of software engineering practices could increase the
 correctness of scientific software and the efficiency of its
 development. While there is still potential for increased use of these
 practices, scientific software developers have begun to embrace software
 engineering practices to improve their software. Additionally, software
 engineering practices still need to be tailored to better fit the needs
 of scientific software development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  Abstract                 = {{Akari Software offers a family of software products supporting
 curriculum management in higher education. The work started with one
 specific commission, but within 4years, a small product suite had been
 developed, with ten organisations using customised variants of those
 products. In effect, a product family had been created but without the
 underlying structure and processes needed to ensure the efficient
 creation and maintenance of variants. This is a common issue faced by
 software companies as their product range expands. In 2010, Akari began
 making internal changes to develop a product range infrastructure that
 was suitable both for its existing products and its plans for future
 growth. The purpose of this paper is to describe the product line
 transition that occurred, both to share the experience involved and to
 identify a number of general lessons learned. The work was supported by
 a FUSION project, funded by InterTradeIreland, undertaken in
 collaboration with the University of Ulster. Copyright (c) 2014 John

  Abstract                 = {{Context: The analysis and selection of requirements are important parts
 of any release planning process. Previous studies on release planning
 have focused on plan-driven optimization models. Unfortunately, solving
 the release planning problem mechanistically is difficult in an agile
 development context.
 Objective: We describe how a release planning method was employed in two
 case projects in F-Secure, a large Finnish software company. We identify
 the benefits which the projects gained from the method, and analyze
 challenges in the cases and improvements made to the method during the
 case projects.
 Method: We observed five release planning events and four retrospectives
 and we conducted surveys in the first two events. We conducted six
 post-project interviews. We conjoined the observation notes, survey
 results and interviews and analyzed them qualitatively and
 quantitatively.
 Results: The focal point of the method was release planning events where
 the whole project organization gathered to plan the next release. The
 planning was conducted by the development teams in close collaboration
 with each other and with the other stakeholders. We identified ten
 benefits which included improved communication, transparency, dependency
 management and decision making. We identified nine challenges which
 included the lacking preparation and prioritization of requirements,
 unrealistic schedules, insufficient architectural planning and lacking
 agile mindset. The biggest improvements to the method were the
 introduction of frequent status checks and a big visible planning status
 board.
 Conclusion: The release planning method ameliorated many difficult
 characteristics of the release planning problem but its efficiency was
 negatively affected by the performing organization that was in
 transition from a plan-driven to an agile development mindset. Even in
 this case the benefits clearly outweighed the challenges and the method
 enabled the early identification of the issues in the project. (C) 2014

 While, a typical development organization (could be a business unit

 handled in an ad hoc or detached way. However, research shows that there
 is a tight link between the product architecture and its developing
 organization. In this paper we have studied an organization within
 Ericsson, which focuses on the development of large software and
 hardware products. We have applied the hidden structure method, which is
 based on the Design Structure Matrix approach, to analyze of
 organizational transformations. The to-be scenarios are possible
 alternatives in trying to become more agile and lean. Our analysis shows
 that one scenario likely increases the complexity of developing the
 product, while the other two suggestions are both promising to-be
 scenarios.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The adoption of innovative Software Engineering (SE) processes by an
 organization implies that engineers have to learn new processes which
 they might not be familiar with. Social software can support and enhance
 this adoption process, so research needs to focus on how the exchange of
 knowledge among software engineers using these tools can help to perform
 training more effectively. We propose a framework based on social
 software to support the collaborative learning, adoption and improvement
 of SE processes through the exchange of experiences among individuals.
 This article examines factors influencing the adoption of new SE
 processes and the quality of the experiences shared using the proposed
 framework in comparison with similar ones. Two case studies were carried
 out involving junior engineers in a training course on agile software
 development. Anonymous surveys collected data on the perceived quality
 of the experiences shared during the research, their usefulness, and the
 simplicity of the mechanisms provided to contribute experiences. Results
 show that the adoption of new SE processes is influenced by several
 factors such as the commitment of software engineers to collaborate in
 the adoption of the new process, the perceived level of usefulness of
 the tacit knowledge elicited during the adoption process, the diversity
 of the topics covered by the shared knowledge, the simplicity of the
 mechanisms to contribute new tacit knowledge, and the amount of learning
 achieved by software engineers.}},

 declarative database evolution language, which couples both schema and

 languages focus on usability but did not aim for completeness. However,
 this is an inevitable prerequisite for reasonable database evolution to
 avoid complex and error-prone workarounds. We argue that relational
 completeness is the feasible expressiveness for a database evolution

  Abstract                 = {{This paper proposes a method for deciding whether to insert an agile
 process as part of a waterfall project. Recently, many software projects
 adopt an agile software methodology. Still, some software is developed
 with traditional waterfall methodologies. Agile methods claim a strength
 of flexibility for uncertain changes, yet in some cases the initial
 expected scope of the project cannot be realized or undetected errors
 remain because schedules are fixed and unexpected backlog of tests and
 bug fixes remain unaddressed. On the other hand, a waterfall methodology
 can include high risk of violating schedule targets, while fulfilling
 the initially expected scope with comprehensive tests so that more
 complex products are reliable. For the decision whether to develop in
 waterfall or agile, our approach is to evaluate the effects on
 uncertainties by adoption of agile techniques. We begin with focus on
 uncertain rework. The effects on rework are evaluated as cost using
 simulation. The decision making problem is modeled as a decision tree.
 In the simulation, a Software Reliability Growth Model is used as an
 error likelihood and detection model. This proposed method is
 demonstrated using a simple shopping web site. As a case study, the
 effects on rework by adoption of agile can be evaluated using the
 developed simulator. With comparison of predicted rework costs given a
 balance of waterfall or agile methods for a specific case, the project
 can be designed more effectively.}},

 concurrent predevelopment of new products and production technologies.
 Volatile requirements and complex interdependencies are the main
 challenges which agile methods originating from software development are
 designed for. To examine transferability of several agile methods to the
 predevelopment of hardware, the authors first theoretically analysed
 existing methods regarding their potential. While adopting the most
 promising methods, a case study regarding the production technology for
 electrical energy storage systems was conducted. It showed that many
 agile aspects and tools are easily adoptable and help developers in the
 early stage depending on group size and complexity. They contribute by
 ensuring that complexity remains manageable, encouraging close teamwork,
 improving information circulation and supporting transparency. Thus
 agile methods supplement concurrent predevelopment. (C) 2016 The

  Abstract                 = {{Context A number of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies
 (SLRs) covering numerous primary research studies on various aspects of
 agile software development (ASD) exist.
 Objective: The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs
 on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and
 practitioners.
 Method: We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al.
 to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015.
 Results: We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas:
 adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability,
 global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded
 systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on
 ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in
 general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized
 guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be
 slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While
 some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of
 authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review
 recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of
 connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and
 GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on
 management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different
 contexts such as embedded systems.
 Conclusion: SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of
 ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of
 ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from
 further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and
 challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups,
 sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as
 a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post
 2008. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The last decade is characterized, in many IT companies, by changing the
 system development life cycle methodology from the classical waterfall
 or prototype methods to the agile methodology of development. The agile
 methodology, developed in the beginning of 2000's, encourages the
 development of working software within a defined framework, while
 accepting changes and keeping the customer involved during the whole
 project. The present paper examines the relationship between the project
 management-customer's communication and the project success. The agile
 software development methodology was introduced in February 2001, when
 the Agile Manifesto was conceived, based on four values: (1) Individuals
 and interactions over processes and tools; (2) Working software over
 comprehensive documentation; (3) Customer collaboration over contract
 negotiation; and (4) Responding to change over following a plan. The
 scrum model for developing software applies the agile values and
 methodology while presenting a framework, terminology, roles and
 ceremonies to perform successful projects. The core roles include the
 development team, the scrum master, and the product owner who represents
 the customer and the users. Effective communication with the various
 stakeholders in a scrum project, aimed to develop a new product or
 software, is essential. The scrum method defines a series of sprints, of
 two to four weeks, in which the team performs the tasks to be completed.
 The current paper presents a quantitative research, where 61 managers
 and customers of IT scrum projects, answered a reliable questionnaire.
 The study investigated the perceived success of agile projects as
 measured by meeting schedule, budget and performance requirements, as
 well as customer satisfaction and long term achievements such as
 business objectives and development of core competencies. Findings
 reveal that effective communication is a dominant factor in a success
 scrum project. Furthermore, the communications with the customer was
 characterized by the following items: face-to-face conversations,
 telephone and email correspondences, and accepting changes following
 conversations with the customer. Analysis of the virtual communication
 tools effectiveness shows that although the project team members are
 satisfied with the use of these communication media tools, the tools are
 usually not evaluated on an economical basis but rather based on a
 convenience of use. The study highlights the importance of
 communications management in IT project management as applied these
 days. Professionals and project managers should be aware to the impact
 of effective communications on the project success and to be able to
 identify the weak areas in their arena of communications.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Software-Defined Networking (SDN) provides the capability to steer
 traffic in a network to lower the management cost. Network Function
 Virtualization (NFV) gives the chance to implement network functions at
 the right time and the right place to increase operation flexibility.
 Together SDN and NFV show the potential to create an agile system with a
 low operations cost and a high customer satisfaction. However, the
 combination of SDN with NFV results in the redundant packet forwarding
 traffic inside SDN in order to forward packets based on the deployed
 network functions for a service chain. Besides, it also increase the
 computation requirement of a controller for possible packet header
 modifications and flow states management. In this paper, we propose to
 implement network functions on SDN switches to lower the traffic inside
 of SDN and the computation requirement of a SDN controller. We create
 network function modules for open virtual switches and make those
 functions to be managed by a controller with an algorithm to streamline
 the implemented service chains. Our results show that the proposed
 system can reduce about 2/3 of current network traffic compared to the
 current solutions without the modification of forwarding tables and
 packets.}},

 IBM Rational tools. It is well known that EssUP is practice separation
 and lightweight and UP is an integrated and heavyweight process. In this
 paper, we introduce and characterize EssUP by systematically comparing
 it with traditional RUP from different aspects such as separation of
 concerns, flexibility, presentation, and tailorable. Comparison results
 show that EssUP is very flexible to be adopted, adapted, and configured.
 In other words, there is no actual process for EssUP and EssUP is just
 composed of a set of selected practices. Moreover, to successfully apply
 EssUP requires experiences and expertise. The contribution of the paper
 is that we provide readers a comprehensive and insight view of EssUP by
 thoroughly comparing it with commonly-used RUP.}},

 architecture (SOA) projects in practice. The aim of these projects has
 been to develop a shared document service supporting different business
 divisions in a large Norwegian governmental institution. The research
 question guiding this research is: How are SOA projects carried out in
 practice? What are the challenges of developing shared services in
 service-oriented architecture? SOA projects are accompanied by a complex
 sociotechnical system development environment. In the present study we
 followed parallel system development processes and identified several
 issues associated with competence requirements, distributed coordination
 principles and control, lack of communication, tuning of parallel
 projects, and selection of appropriate project management approaches and
 system development methods. Clearly, there was a difference between
 undertaking a system development project within one organizational unit
 (silo) compared to the development of shared services to provide support
 across a large organization. Findings demonstrate that the complexity of
 SOA projects was underestimated by the project managers, and ad hoc
 governance was practiced in terms of control, coordination, and
 communication. To capture the entire system development context of an
 SOA project, a holistic approach and mind-set comprising time management
 and fine tuning of all parallel SD activities is necessary.
 Organizational maturity to carry out SOA projects is also of
 significance. The study has implications for SOA adopters in general and
 for system developers and project managers working in an SOA context in
 particular. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

 environment is highly challenging traditional Requirements Engineering

 working in such dynamic environment, as a result, either by or without
 their awareness agile methodologies are adopted in various phases of
 their software development cycles. The aim of this paper is to
 investigate the adherence degree of agile RE practices in various
 software development organizations that are classifying themselves as
 adopting traditional (i.e. non-agile) software development
 methodologies. An approach is proposed for achieving this aim and it is
 applied on five different projects from four different organizations.

  Abstract                 = {{Developing software by teams which adopted the agile development
 methodology such as Scrum seems totally natural in industry. On the
 other hand, students belonging to graduate schools of information
 science who have some experience on the agile team software development
 are rare. In the initial education on the Scrum, there exists some
 challenges. The first one is a concept of self-organization. In the
 Scrum project, members of the team determine how best to accomplish the
 tasks by themselves. However, it is challenging for students with less
 experience on team software development to cultivate the self-organizing
 team by themselves. The 2nd one is inequality on task assignment. In the
 Scrum project, each member pulls tasks to perform, and do not wait to be
 assigned by Project Manager. The assignment behavior may cause
 inequality on task assignment. As a result, such inequality may also
 cause inequality on learning opportunities to acquire skills and
 knowledge on the process and the product. In this paper, we propose
 quantitative assessment methods for the Scrum project with using
 TiDD(Ticket Driven Development) for the initial education on the Scrum
 framework and web application production. We report on our basic
 PBL(Project-Based Learning) course which involved 49 students. The use
 of quantitative criteria enabled students and teachers to assess the
 Scrum projects in the viewpoints of quality, assignment, and delivery of
 projects.}},

 marked by extensive collaboration, i.e. face-to-face communication.
 Although claimed to be beneficial, the software development community as
 a whole is still unfamiliar with the role of the requirements
 engineering practices in agile methods. The term ``agile requirements
 engineering{''} is used to define the ``agile way{''} of planning,
 executing and reasoning about requirements engineering activities.
 Moreover, not much is known about the challenges posed by
 collaboration-oriented agile way of dealing with requirements
 engineering activities. Our goal is to map the evidence available about
 requirements engineering practices adopted and challenges faced by agile
 teams in order to understand how traditional requirements engineering
 issues are resolved using agile requirements engineering. We conducted a
 systematic review of literature published between 2002 and June 2013 and
 identified 21 papers, that discuss agile requirements engineering. We
 formulated and applied specific inclusion and exclusion criteria in two
 distinct rounds to determine the most relevant studies for our research
 goal. The review identified 17 practices of agile requirements
 engineering, five challenges traceable to traditional requirements
 engineering that were overcome by agile requirements engineering, and
 eight challenges posed by the practice of agile requirements
 engineering. However, our findings suggest that agile requirements
 engineering as a research context needs additional attention and more
 empirical results are required to better understand the impact of agile
 requirements engineering practices e.g. dealing with non-functional
 requirements and self-organising teams. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

  Abstract                 = {{The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) and
 Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) completed a successful at-sea
 exercise with autonomous UAS and UUV systems demonstrating cross-domain
 unmanned system communication and collaboration. The exercise was held
 at the NUWC Narragansett Bay Shallow Water Test Facility (NBSWTF) range,
 and it represented for the first time the use of standard protocols and
 formats that effectively support cross-domain unmanned system
 operations. Four man-portable Iver2 UUVs operating in coordinated
 missions autonomously collected environmental data, which was compressed
 in-stride, re-formatted, and exfiltrated via UAS relay for display and
 tactical decision making. Two UAS with autonomous flight take-off and
 mission execution were sequenced to serve as ISR platforms and to
 support communications as RF relays for the UUVs performing Intelligence
 Preparation of the Environment missions. Two Command and Control nodes
 ashore provided unmanned system tasking and re-tasking, and they served
 to host and display both geo-positional data and status for UAS and UUV
 vehicles during the operational scenarios run during the exercise. The
 SAE Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JAUS) standards were used
 for all message traffic between shore-based C2 nodes, UAS, and UUVs
 active in the NBSWTF exercise area.
 Exercise goals focused on CNO priorities expressed in the Undersea
 Domain Operating Concept of AUG 2013 which emphasized protocols
 essential to effective command and control of networked unmanned systems
 with decentralization and flexibility of command structures. Development
 for this project highlighted both the strengths and shortfalls of JAUS
 and captured the requirements for moving forward in effective
 cross-domain communications that support distributed, agile C2 nodes to
 meet evolving CONOPS for growing unmanned system presence and mission
 roles. The scenario employed operating parameters for UAS and UUV that
 have been established in real-world operations and ongoing unmanned
 system programs. The tactical information from unmanned systems was
 displayed in real-time on shore-based C2 displays: the tactical
 FalconView display and the developmental TOPSIDE command and control
 station.
 This work represents a critical step in communications for networking of
 heterogeneous unmanned systems and establishes a solid platform for
 alignment of development and ongoing programs. The evaluation of JAUS
 suitability for near-term operational applications provides significant
 value as Concepts of Operation that rely on netted heterogeneous systems
 are being targeted. The focus on affordable commercial unmanned systems
 for this experimentation establishes the value of highly capable,
 portable systems to provide economical development and test
 opportunities with low-cost and low-risk alternatives to many planned
 and fielded systems. The JAUS architecture was introduced to the NUWC
 and GTRI unmanned systems though an instantiation of the Mission
 Oriented Operating Suite (MOOS) autonomy framework on secondary CPUs
 integrated into the Iver2 UUVs and the GTRI UAS. Since the GTRI UASs
 already had ROS installed, a MOOS-ROS bridge was employed to support use
 of the developed JAUS messaging capability. Established JAUS services
 were employed where the required functions could be met. New JAUS
 services were developed to meet functionality required for the
 operational scenarios in this exercise but not yet supported in the
 existing releases of SAE JAUS. Independent C++ header libraries that
 could be compiled at run time for specific autonomy frameworks, such as
 MOOS, were employed to support a software-agnostic approach.
 Immediate targets for broadening the influence of this work to coalition
 partners include the NATO Recognized Environmental Picture (REP) 2015
 and The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP) 2015 exercises. This
 project and demonstration was funded under a NUWC Strategic Initiative
 and GTRI program support.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In Computer Science Education, teaching of computer programming (CP) for
 beginners remains one of the greatest challenges. This is due to the
 nature of first year students characterized by under-preparedness, poor
 academic background and so on. Moreover, the traditional lecture-based
 approach is used and the computer laboratories are rarely used.
 Consequently, students are not motivated, engaged or no active
 participation. While this teaching approach has failed to achieve
 learning outcome, incorporating cutting-edge practices like agile
 methods into the teaching could be valuable. This stems from the
 widespread in practice and acceptance of agile methods in the software
 industries today. Though agile practices like pair programming have
 impacted students' programming projects, none has been reported on
 teaching. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach of teaching CP
 using the agile methods. The goal is to assist beginners acquire needed
 programming skills, proffer teaching technique that maximizes the
 chances of engagement, active participation, and improving teaching by
 reflecting on what has been taught and what the students are learning.
 Additionally, beginners will be able to operate the computer, write
 correct code, gain better programming skills and assist teachers to
 manage large classes effectively. To achieve this, the study adopted the
 framework for decoding the discipline.}},

 maintainable and reusable systems, but the complexity resulting from its
 features usually introduce some faults that are difficult to detect or
 anticipate during software change process. Thus, the earlier they are
 detected, found and fixed, the lesser the maintenance costs. Several OO
 metrics have been proposed for assessing the quality of OO design and
 code and several empirical studies have been undertaken to validate the
 impact of OO metrics on fault proneness (FP). The question now is which
 metrics are useful in measuring the FP of OO classes? Consequently, we
 investigate the existing empirical validation of CK + SLOC metrics based
 on their state of significance, validation and usefulness. We used
 systematic literature review (SLR) methodology over a number of relevant
 article sources, and our results show the existence of 29 relevant
 empirical studies. Further analysis indicates that coupling, complexity
 and size measures have strong impact on FP of OO classes. Based on the
 results, we therefore conclude that these metrics can be used as good
 predictors for building quality fault models when that could assist in
 focusing resources on high risk components that are liable to cause
 system failures, when only CK + SLOC metrics are used.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Due to performing complex and crucial tasks in industry, the control
 software should be created in a way ensuring possibly the highest
 quality. It can be increased by modeling, standardized implementation,
 and precise testing. The latter should verify not only functional
 requirements, but also nonfunctional, such as performance. In the paper,
 a concept of agile POU-oriented performance testing is proposed, which
 is dedicated to the IEC 61131-3 standard. The approach allows to measure
 and analyze execution times of particular Program Organization Units.
 The concept supports multiple target platforms and allows to take
 performance into account during early development stages, as well as to
 perform regression testing. The proposed process consists of a few
 stages, namely modeling (using SysML diagrams), implementation (in a
 dedicated test definition language), and execution (by a dedicated
 testing framework). The approach has been introduced into the CPDev
 engineering environment for programming industrial controllers.}},

 brittle and inflexible toolchains with little to no reusability.
 This paper presents SENSEI, an approach to enable the implementation of
 an integration framework for software evolution tools using
 component-based, service-oriented, and model-driven methods, to ease
 toolchain creation and enable agile execution of software evolution
 projects. It will be evaluated by implementing and using it to build the

 quality during development and may desire to compare with the quality of
 a large number of products produced in the past. In this paper, we focus
 on the reliability aspects of software quality and discuss the
 applicability of conventional reliability metrics to iterative
 development. First, we defined the general process structure in
 iterative development. Then, we present an associated quality evaluation
 scheme closely. Our experimental results indicate that traditional
 quality metrics were applicable to iterative development and that the
 iterative development achieved maturity sufficient for the commercial

  Abstract                 = {{When CERN migrated its infrastructure away from homegrown fabric
 management tools to emerging industry-standard open-source solutions,
 the immediate technical challenges and motivation were clear. The move
 to a multi-site Cloud Computing model meant that the tool chains that
 were growing around this ecosystem would be a good choice, the challenge
 was to leverage them. The use of open-source tools brings challenges
 other than merely how to deploy them. Homegrown software, for all the
 deficiencies identified at the outset of the project, has the benefit of
 growing with the organization. This paper will examine what challenges
 there were in adapting open-source tools to the needs of the
 organization, particularly in the areas of multi-group development and
 security. Additionally, the increase in scale of the plant required
 changes to how Change Management was organized and managed. Continuous
 Integration techniques are used in order to manage the rate of change
 across multiple groups, and the tools and workflow for this will be
 examined.}},

 Agile software methodology. Initially users at 7 hospitals were engaged
 in the system design and iteratively trained in system use. Subsequently
 the national roll-out began with a further 8 hospitals trained in the
 system by October 2012. More than 150 hospitals are expected to have the
 system in place by January 1st 2014 and nation-wide implementation is
 expected to complete by 2017. Analysis of training challenges is based

 is anticipated insights presented will support an improved national
 roll-out of the system
 Results: Training approaches and user training requirements varied
 considerably between users involved in the initial development and the
 users to whom the developed system was subsequently introduced.
 Significantly, the system changed medical workflow such that the project
 had to extend training beyond system usage and into the medical
 processes of diagnostic records management. Engagement of system users
 through the Agile methodology imparts system knowledge and training not
 readily available to subsequent users exposed during roll-out. This
 posed a number of training challenges that had not been foreseen during
 project planning. The paper highlights the need for comprehensive
 consideration of all aspects of workflow including non-technical
 dimensions to support a smooth national roll-out.
 Conclusions: eHealth system training should not be limited to system use
 without a detailed consideration of how clinical practice and clinical
 workflow will be transformed. Recognising differences between training
 needs of initial users involved in system design and those subsequently
 expected to use a system needs attention. On-going iterative evaluation
 of system use and system outputs is required to iteratively refining
 training programs.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Agile release engineering (ARE) practices are designed to
 deliver software faster and cheaper to end users; hence, claims of such
 impacts should be validated by rigorous and relevant empirical studies.
 Objective: The study objective was to analyze both direct and indirect
 impacts of ARE practices as well as to determine how they have been
 empirically studied.
 Method: The study applied the systematic literature review research
 method. ARE practices were identified in empirical studies by searching
 articles for ``rapid release,{''} ``continuous integration,{''}
 ``continuous delivery,{''} and ``continuous deployment.{''} We
 systematically analyzed 619 articles and selected 71 primary studies for
 deeper investigation. The impacts of ARE practices were analyzed from
 three viewpoints: impacts associated with adoption of the practice,
 prevalence of the practice, and success of software development.
 Results: The results indicated that ARE practices can create shorter
 lead times and better communication Within and between development
 teams. However, challenges and drawbacks were also found in change
 management, software quality assurance, and stakeholder acceptance. The
 analysis revealed that 33 out of 71 primary studies were casual
 experience reports that had neither an explicit research method nor a
 data collection approach specified, and 23 out of 38 empirical studies
 applied qualitative methods, such as interviews, among practitioners.
 Additionally, 12 studies applied quantitative methods, such as mining of
 software repositories. Only three empirical studies combined these
 research approaches.
 Conclusion: ARE practices can contribute to improved efficiency of the
 development process. Moreover, release stakeholders can develop a better
 understanding of the software project's status. Future empirical studies
 should consider the comprehensive reporting of the context and how the
 practice is implemented instead of merely referring to usage of the
 practice. In addition, different stakeholder points of view, such as
 customer perceptions regarding ARE practices, still clearly require
 further research. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

 element of SDN architectures is the controller. This logically
 centralized entity acts as a network operating system, providing
 applications with a uniform and centralized programming interface to the
 underlying network. But it also introduces new security challenges. The
 challenge of building robust firewalls is the main challenge for
 protection of OpenFlow networks. The main problem with traditional
 firewall is that Network Administrator cannot modify/extend the
 capabilities of traditional vendor-specific firewall. Network
 Administrator can only configure the firewall according to the
 specifications given by the firewall vendor. To solve these problems we
 developed stateful firewall application that runs over SDN controller to
 show that most of the firewall functionalities can be built on software,
 without the aid of a dedicated hardware.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Objective To develop expeditiously a pragmatic, modular, and extensible
 software framework for understanding and improving healthcare value
 (costs relative to outcomes).
 Materials and methods In 2012, a multidisciplinary team was assembled by
 the leadership of the University of Utah Health Sciences Center and
 charged with rapidly developing a pragmatic and actionable analytics
 framework for understanding and enhancing healthcare value. Based on an
 analysis of relevant prior work, a value analytics framework known as
 Value Driven Outcomes (VDO) was developed using an agile methodology.
 Evaluation consisted of measurement against project objectives,
 including implementation timeliness, system performance, completeness,
 accuracy, extensibility, adoption, satisfaction, and the ability to
 support value improvement.
 Results A modular, extensible framework was developed to allocate
 clinical care costs to individual patient encounters. For example, labor
 costs in a hospital unit are allocated to patients based on the hours
 they spent in the unit; actual medication acquisition costs are
 allocated to patients based on utilization; and radiology costs are
 allocated based on the minutes required for study performance. Relevant
 process and outcome measures are also available. A visualization layer
 facilitates the identification of value improvement opportunities, such
 as high-volume, high-cost case types with high variability in costs
 across providers. Initial implementation was completed within 6 months,
 and all project objectives were fulfilled. The framework has been
 improved iteratively and is now a foundational tool for delivering
 high-value care.
 Conclusions The framework described can be expeditiously implemented to
 provide a pragmatic, modular, and extensible approach to understanding
 and improving healthcare value.}},

 which are behind schedule or highly likely to have a problematic
 development phase. In the last decade, Agile methods have transformed
 from cult techniques to mainstream methodologies. Scrum, an Agile
 software development method, has been widely adopted due to its adaptive
 nature. This paper presents a metric that measures the quality of the
 testing process in a Scrum process. As product quality and process
 quality correlate, improved test quality can ensure high-quality
 products. Also, gaining experience from 8 years of successful Scrum
 implementation at SoftwarePeople, we describe the Scrum process
 emphasizing the testing process. We propose a metric Product Backlog
 Rating (PBR) to assess the testing process in Scrum. PBR considers the
 complexity of the features to be developed in an iteration of Scrum,
 assesses test ratings and offers a numerical score of the testing
 process. This metric is able to provide a comprehensive overview of the
 testing process over the development cycle of a product. We present a
 case study which shows how the metric is used at SoftwarePeople. The
 case study explains some features that have been developed in a Sprint
 in terms of feature complexity and potential test assessment
 difficulties and shows how PBR is calculated during the Sprint. We
 propose a test process assessment metric that provides insights into the
 Scrum testing process. However, the metric needs further evaluation
 considering associated resources (e.g., quality assurance engineers, the
 length of the Scrum cycle).}},

 motivate the approach using theory on interdependence and coordination,

 service-dominant logic. We also examine the effects of its adoption at a
 large electrical power company over a three-year period. The results
 imply that service-oriented theory should be applied to the human
 processes involved in systems development in order to achieve better fit

 concepts related to the main concern of Meeting User Expectations. In
 trying to resolve the main concern, the Scrum project stakeholders
 alluded to lack of ``Concrete Guidance{''} on SQA strategies, tools, and
 techniques in Scrum. The lack of concrete guidance in Scrum requires a
 development team to devise Innovations which may include Adopting
 Practices from other methodologies and carefully designing the Process
 Structure to accommodate the Adopted Practices, ensure Continuous
 Improvement of the process, and provide an environment for Collaborative
 Ownership. By demonstrating the incompleteness of Agile methods with
 particular attention to the lack of concrete guidance in Scrum, the
 study draws on method tailoring literature to argue for customisation of
 Scrum. The study further proposes that Scrum needs to be viewed as a
 framework of `empty buckets' which need to be filled with situation
 specific SQA practices and processes in order to meet user expectations}},

  Abstract                 = {{Software is a general term for the various kinds of programs used to
 operate computers and various related devices. Software mainly consists
 of carefully-organized instructions and code written by developers in
 any of various special programming languages. Software impacts on the
 general public and society keeps on being profound. As the significance
 of software development model develops, the software community
 consistently attempts to develop new technologies that will make it much
 faster, easier, and less expensive to construct good-quality software's.
 The software development life cycle model is a framework which consists
 of sequence of activities followed by the system designers and software
 developers. It comprises of a sequence of various different phases or
 stages in which every phase of the SDLC utilizes the outcomes of the
 previous phase. Previously developed models such as Incremental model,
 Spiral Model, Prototyping model, Agile Models, waterfall model, RAD
 model, Transformation model were successful in the early stages of
 software development cycle which later brings out some obstacles such as
 less customer satisfaction as per their requirements, high risk and cost
 involved, time complexity and many more. The present research emphasizes
 a new model which focuses on full-filling the targeted objectives based
 on the better understanding of customer's requirements.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Network service providers are facing challenges for deploying new
 services mainly due to the growing complexity of software architecture
 and development process. Moreover, the recent architectural innovation
 of network systems such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV),
 Software-defined Networking (SDN), and Cloud computing increases the
 development and operation complexity yet again. One of the emerging
 solutions to this problem is a novel software development concept,
 namely DevOps, that is widely employed by major Internet software
 companies. Although the goals of DevOps in data centers are well-suited
 for the demands of agile service creation, additional requirements
 specific to the virtualized and software-defined network environment are
 important to be addressed from the perspective of modern network
 carriers.
 In this paper, we thoroughly debate DevOps requirements for developing a
 modern service creation platform by taking EU FP7 project UNIFY as a
 reference architecture and suggest the corresponding extensions of UNIFY
 interfaces that meet the discovered requirements.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Software development is conducted in increasingly dynamic business
 environments. Organizations need the capability to develop, release and
 learn from software in rapid parallel cycles. The abilities to
 continuously deliver software, to involve users, and to collect and
 prioritize their feedback are necessary for software evolution. In 2014,
 we introduced Rugby, an agile process model with workflows for
 continuous delivery and feedback management, and evaluated it in
 university projects together with industrial clients.
 Based on Rugby's release management workflow we identified the specific
 needs for project-based organizations developing mobile applications.
 Varying characteristics and restrictions in projects teams in corporate
 environments impact both process and infrastructure. We found that
 applicability and acceptance of continuous delivery in industry depend
 on its adaptability. To address issues in industrial projects with
 respect to delivery process, infrastructure, neglected testing and
 continuity, we extended Rugby's workflow and made it tailorable.
 Eight projects at Capgemini, a global provider of consulting, technology
 and outsourcing services, applied a tailored version of the workflow.
 The evaluation of these projects shows anecdotal evidence that the
 application of the workflow significantly reduces the time required to
 build and deliver mobile applications in industrial projects, while at
 the same time increasing the number of builds and internal deliveries
 for feedback.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Case management comprises various complex activities. Consequently, case
 managers have to balance very diverging requirements and needs, while at
 the same time facing increasingly complex decisions. Case management
 software systems (CMS) provide capabilities such as information
 assessment and handling, decision and collaboration management as well
 as flexible process guidance to support case managers. When introducing
 a CMS into an organization, a maturity model of IT-based case management
 helps in mastering different levels of technology adoption by exploiting
 technological benefits and carefully addressing associated risks. In
 this paper, we propose the C3M maturity model for IT-based case
 management that links maturity levels with sets of capabilities that are
 typical for case management in social work, health care, and the
 handling of complex claims in insurance. The model focuses on the impact
 of technology and is linked to a map of benefits and risks across five
 impact areas. Each impact area is characterized by six impact factors
 that we consider as especially important when managing IT technology
 adoption within case management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

 usage in embedded system development is often limited to software. A
 case study of three industrial cases was carried out to understand how
 to tailor agile methods effectively including also hardware development.
 Agile practices, mostly derived from Scrum, were tailored to fit the
 needs of each team and the method development was closely followed.
 Surveys conducted in the beginning and in the end of the cases were
 compared and complemented with interviews to understand the new working
 methods and their effects.
 Case evidence shows that interdependencies between work of each
 developer were taken into account better, visibility over the whole
 product increased and need for internal documentation diminished due to
 improved communication, but dividing hardware tasks into iterations was
 experienced difficult. With some tailoring, agile practices are
 beneficial also in the embedded system development.
 To successfully adopt agile methods into embedded system development,
 the team must consist of all the project members, the natural cycle
 lengths of different disciplines and different knowledge between the
 developers must be accepted and built upon, and the progress of the
 product must be presented or visualized in the end of each iteration.

 agile practices in order to benefit from the improvements they clearly
 bring, in terms of production speed and software quality, for example.
 However, in a large, distributed organization, such as Nokia Siemens
 Networks, an agile transformation may be a long-term, complex process,
 and therefore, evaluating the benefits achieved, and measuring the
 success of the change, can be difficult, especially in the early phases
 of the transformation. This paper is based on the results of a case
 study on the impact introducing agile practices actually had in a large,
 software-development organization, part of Nokia Siemens Networks. The
 impact of this agile transformation was evaluated in terms of how well
 it succeeded in achieving the goals set by the management before the
 transformation started. This longitudinal study included two separate
 analyses, made at 6 monthly intervals, which measured what agile
 practices were really in use in the organization, and what effects, if
 any, were visible in terms of the goals which had been set by the
 management The 6 monthly analyses included defect data metrics and
 opinion surveys of the personnel directly involved in the
 transformation. The study showed two things: firstly, that the
 introduction of agile practices does have the beneficial effects that
 one would expect, and secondly, that, using this kind of study, it is
 not only possible to evaluate the impact that the adoption of agile
 practices has in a large, established software-development company, but
 also that the effects are visible at a surprisingly early stage.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The software industry is in the middle of a major change in the fashion
 how services provided by all kinds of information systems are offered to
 the users. This change has been initiated by the customers who no longer
 want to carry out the same responsibilities and risks they previously
 did as system owners. Consequently, the software vendors need to find a
 way to change their mind-sets from software developers to service
 providers, being able to constantly satisfy the changed and new needs of
 their customers. The transformation from the license based software
 development to a SaaS offering poses challenges related not only to
 technical issues but to a great extent also to organisational and even
 mental issues. We reflect the experiences on this transformation
 gathered from two software companies, and, based on these, present some
 prerequisites and guidelines for the transformation to succeed. In
 conclusion, with the SaaS model, many of the principles manifested by
 the agile movement can and should be followed closely and the advantages
 gained with the SaaS model are very close to the objectives set by the
 agile manifesto.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Agile methods are widely adopted in software development. They are based
 on agile principles that sharply contrast to traditional
 command-and-control management methods. Such methods emphasize the
 importance of highly interactive self-organizing teams and close
 collaboration of all stakeholders, as well as values like courage,
 openness and respect. However, recent studies show that graduates and
 undergraduates of computer science often lack the collaborative and
 communicative skills necessary for agile methods and, thus, are not yet
 well enough educated for agile development approaches. Therefore, new
 approaches or more adequate educational methods for teaching the
 necessary communication and collaboration skills need to be developed.
 In a recent interview study, the authors elicited specific collaboration
 and communication skills needed in agile teams. In this paper, we
 present results from this study and discuss teaching concepts for
 collaboration skills from both engineering and psychological points of
 view. We suggest an approach on how to integrate these concepts into
 university courses, that focuses on active learning of agile
 collaboration. We have started implementing the proposed concept in a
 software engineering course and report on the experiences we have made
 and on the challenges that we have encountered.}},

 on for years before the customer was able to lay his hands on the
 product he had ordered. This often resulted in delays, budget overruns
 and disappointing deliverables. During the last decade, the Agile
 approach has been taking over software project management, shortening
 product development cycles from a few years to a few weeks or even days.
 Recently, the agile approach has even been used for developing a new car

 Several recent surveys {[}2], {[}3] show that agile methodologies like
 Scrum, Extreme Programming or Kanban have successfully been adopted by
 many companies to develop software. However, agile methodologies do not
 come for free. A different set of skills, or agile practices as they are

  Abstract                 = {{Continuous delivery is a set of practices and principles to release
 software faster and more frequently. While it helps to bridge the gap
 between developers and operations for software in production, it can
 also improve the communication between developers and customers in the
 development phase, i.e. before software is in production. It shortens
 the feedback cycle and developers ideally use it right from the
 beginning of a software development project.
 In this paper we describe the implementation of a customized continuous
 delivery workflow and its benefits in a multi-customer project course in
 summer 2013. Our workflow focuses on the ability to deliver software
 with only a few clicks to the customer in order to obtain feedback as
 early as possible. This helps developers to validate their understanding
 about requirements, which is especially helpful in agile projects where
 requirements might change often. We describe how we integrated this
 workflow and the role of the release manager into our project-based
 organization and how we introduced it using different teaching methods.
 Within three months 90 students worked in 10 different projects with
 real customers from industry and delivered 490 releases. After the
 project course we evaluated our approach in an online questionnaire and
 in personal interviews. Our findings and observations show that
 participating students understood and applied the concepts and are
 convinced about the benefits of continuous delivery.}},

 The agile philosophy promotes incremental and iterative design and
 implementation. Each iterations, delivers one or more product features.
 Release planning is a main activity in any of Agile approach. Main
 factors that need to be considered are the technical precedence inherent
 in the requirements; the feature's business value perceived by project
 stake holders, team capacity and required effort to complete the
 requirement. There are multiple tools available in industry to manage
 project but they are lacking to provide planning while considering all
 these factors. Genetic algorithms (GA) have arisen from concepts,
 introduced from the natural process of biological evolution. GA uses
 selection, crossover and mutation to evolve a solution to the given
 problem. In this paper an attempt has been made to formalize the release
 planning. Then an approach is proposed to do Release planning using
 genetic algorithms.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Software industry has widely adopted Agile software development
 methods. Agile literature proposes a few key metrics but little is known
 of the actual metrics use in Agile teams. Objective: The objective of
 this paper is to increase knowledge of the reasons for and effects of
 using metrics in industrial Agile development. We focus on the metrics
 that Agile teams use, rather than the ones used from outside by software
 engineering researchers. In addition, we analyse the influence of the
 used metrics.
 Method: This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on
 using metrics in industrial Agile software development. We identified
 774 papers, which we reduced to 30 primary studies through our paper
 selection process.
 Results: The results indicate that the reasons for and the effects of
 using metrics are focused on the following areas: sprint planning,
 progress tracking, software quality measurement, fixing software process
 problems, and motivating people. Additionally, we show that although
 Agile teams use many metrics suggested in the Agile literature, they
 also use many custom metrics. Finally, the most influential metrics in
 the primary studies are Velocity and Effort estimate.
 Conclusion: The use of metrics in Agile software development is similar
 to Traditional software development. Projects and sprints need to be
 planned and tracked. Quality needs to be measured. Problems in the
 process need to be identified and fixed. Future work should focus on
 metrics that had high importance but low prevalence in our study, as
 they can offer the largest impact to the software industry. (C) 2015

  Abstract                 = {{Purpose - Agile methodologies are widely used to manage the technical
 complexity of software development, and project governance can provide
 feasible means of organizational support for complex project success.
 The purpose of this paper is to: analyze the project governance
 practices of public sector organizations, illustrate what kind of impact
 these practices have on agile software projects and describe the
 tensions of agile project governance.
 Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on qualitative
 research strategy and applies elaborative logic with analyses of three
 case projects in the Finnish public sector.
 Findings - The findings of the research describe how project governance
 practices can be categorized into six dimensions: business case,
 contracting, controlling, steering, decision-making and capability
 building. The results illustrate how these practices either support or
 detract the performance of agile projects. The results also show that
 there are two interfaces to agile project that create most tensions to
 governance - the public sector and technology.
 Originality/value - The study contributes to both project management and
 information and communication technology theories by combining technical
 aspects of agile methodologies with micro-level project governance
 practices. The study also adds original value to academics by
 introducing the new concept of ``agile project governance.{''} The
 results of this study will allow public sector project organizations to
 design appropriate governance mechanisms for agile projects, and to
 identify the challenges and tensions that need to be considered and
 managed in the process.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Two project management approaches, Agile and Lean, have increasingly
 been adopted in recent years for software development. Meanwhile, in the
 field of human-computer interaction (HCI), user experience (UX) has
 become central in research and practice. The new hybrids between the two
 fieldsAgile UX and Lean UXwere born a few years ago. As Agile, Lean, and
 UX have different principles and practices, one can query whether the
 couplings are well justified and whether Agile or Lean is more
 compatible with UX work. We have conducted a conceptual analysis and
 tended to conclude that Lean instantiated as Kanban fits UX work better
 than Agile instantiated as Scrum. To explore further our claim, we
 performed a secondary data analysis of 10 semistructured interviews with
 practitioners working with Scrum and Kanban in different sectors (Study
 1). This study enabled us to gain insights into the applications of the
 two processes in real-life cases, their strengths and weaknesses, and
 factors influencing the practicality of implementing them. Both
 processes seem not favorable for UX work in practice. Among others, one
 intriguing observation is loose adherence to the related guidelines and
 principles. A query derived from the analyses of the interviews is that
 customer, as compared with user, has more frequently been referred to by
 our interviewees, irrespective of the process they adopted. We have then
 been motivated to investigate this issue, using a web-based survey with
 another batch of practitioners (N = 73) in the software industry (Study
 2). Results of the survey indicate that the practitioners in general had
 a reasonable understanding of the concepts user and customer, although a
 minority tended to treat them as synonyms. Limitations of the current
 studies and implications for future work are discussed.}},

 because of lack catalog management mechanism, and it makes service mash

  Abstract                 = {{The worldwide mobile software market has grown dramatically since
 feature phones became popular in the early 1990s. In practice, mobile
 usability - which can be defined for a resource-constrained device in
 two ways, namely, User eXperience (UX) and User Interface (UI) - has
 been regarded as the key to gaining superiority in terms of both market
 share and customer loyalty. Unfortunately, de facto standards for
 software design and the development process, such as Unified Modeling
 Language (UML) and Rational Unified Process (RUP), do not seem to
 promote mobile usability in a systematic manner in practice. This paper
 proposes a systematic and generalizable approach to modeling and
 evaluating the properties of mobile usability, herein treating it as a
 first-class software quality from the perspective of software
 engineering. We devise a UX evaluation framework for mobile usability,
 which we call UX Evaluation Framework (UEF) throughout this paper. A UX
 is specified by inter-scene interactions between users and terminals of
 software products using Extended Menu Navigation Viewpoints (EMNVs);
 then, a model checker, NuSMV, is adopted to observe whether the EMNV
 model meets a set of given UX properties. Importantly, the analysis and
 design of RUP is extended to support the co-design of UX and UI so that
 major roles, activities and artifacts in the UX and UI can be explicitly
 monitored and controlled by stakeholders. Through case studies, we
 demonstrate that UEF works properly to treat software products that
 prioritize mobile usability. Consequently, UEF plays a key role in
 filling the gap between two research disciplines to address usability:
 software engineering and human-computer interactions.}},

 embedded in the project elements, we identify the dynamic risks
 threatening the success of a global IT project. Adopting the principles
 of service-oriented architecture (SOA), we further propose a set of
 agile management strategies for mitigating the dynamic risks. The
 mitigation strategies are conceptually validated. The proposed framework
 will help practitioners understand the potential risks in their global

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Root cause analysis (RCA) is a useful practice for software
 project retrospectives, and is typically carried out in synchronous
 collocated face-to-face meetings. Conducting RCA with distributed teams
 is challenging, as face-to-face meetings are infeasible. Lack of
 adequate real-time tool support exacerbates this problem. Furthermore,
 there are no empirical studies on using RCA in synchronous
 retrospectives of geographically distributed teams.
 Objective: This paper presents a real-time cloud-based software tool
 (ARCA-tool) we developed to support RCA in distributed teams and its
 initial empirical evaluation. The feasibility of using RCA with
 distributed teams is also evaluated.
 Method: We compared our tool with 35 existing RCA software tools. We
 conducted field studies of four distributed agile software teams at two
 international software product companies. The teams conducted RCA
 collaboratively in synchronous retrospective meetings by using the tool
 we developed. We collected the data using observations, interviews and
 questionnaires.
 Results: Comparison revealed that none of the existing 35 tools matched
 all the features of our ARCA-tool. The team members found ARCA-tool to
 be an essential part of their distributed retrospectives. They
 considered the software as efficient and very easy to learn and use.
 Additionally, the team members perceived RCA to be a vital part of the
 retrospectives. In contrast to the prior retrospective practices of the
 teams, the introduced RCA method was evaluated as efficient and easy to
 use.
 Conclusion: RCA is a useful practice in synchronous distributed
 retrospectives. However, it requires software tool support for enabling
 real-time view and co-creation of a cause-effect diagram. ARCA-tool
 supports synchronous RCA, and includes support for logging problems and
 causes, problem prioritization, cause-effect diagramming, and logging of
 process improvement proposals. It enables conducting RCA in distributed
 retrospectives. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

 review, cost estimation, preauthorization, accessioning, prebilling,
 testing, reporting, and reimbursement consultation) and obtained
 feedback via an anonymous survey. We managed 50 clinical requests
 (January to June 2015). The fraction of pursued-to-requested cases (n =

 preauthorizations. In 13 of 15 patients the insurance plan required
 preauthorization, which we obtained in 70\% and ultimately achieved
 reimbursement in 50\%. InteroperabiLity enabled assessment of 12
 different combinations of modules that underline the importance of an
 adaptive workflow and policy tailoring to achieve higher yields of

  Abstract                 = {{This paper identifies three problems when testing software that uses
 Hadoop-based big data techniques. First, processing big data takes a
 long time. Second, big data is transferred and transformed among many
 services. Do we need to validate the data at every transition point?
 Third, how should we validate the transferred and transformed data? We
 are developing a novel big data test framework to address these
 problems. The test framework generates a small and representative data
 set from an original large data set using input space partition testing.
 Using this data set for development and testing would not hinder the
 continuous integration and delivery when using agile processes. The test
 framework also accesses and validates data at various transition points
 when data is transferred and transformed.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In the software industry, a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tool,
 Cucumber, has been widely used by practitioners. Usually product
 analysts, developers, and testers manually write BDD test scenarios that
 describe system behaviors. Testers write implementation for the BDD
 scenarios by hand and execute the Cucumber tests. Cucumber provides
 transparency about what test scenarios are covered and how the test
 scenarios are mapped to executable tests. One drawback of the Cucumber
 BDD approach is that test scenarios are generated manually. Thus, the
 test scenarios are usually weak. More importantly, practitioners do not
 have a metric to measure test coverage.
 In this paper, we present a Model-Based Testing (MBT) tool, skyfire.
 Skyfire can automatically generate effective Cucumber test scenarios to
 replace manually generated test scenarios. Skyfire reads a behavioral
 UML diagram (e. g., a state machine diagram), identifies all necessary
 elements (e. g., transitions) of the diagram, generates effective tests
 to satisfy various graph coverage criteria, and converts the tests into
 Cucumber scenarios. Then testers write Cucumber mappings for the
 generated scenarios. Skyfire does not only generate effective tests but
 is also completely compatible with the existing agile development and
 continuous integration (CI) rhythm. We present the design architecture
 and implementation of skyfire, as well as an industrial case study to
 show how skyfire is used in practice.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Big data applications (e.g., Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)
 applications) are designed to handle great volumes of data. However,
 processing such great volumes of data is time-consuming. There is a need
 to construct small yet effective test data sets during agile development
 of big data applications.
 In this paper, we apply a combinatorial test data generation approach to
 two real-world ETL applications at Medidata. In our approach, we first
 create Input Domain Models (IDMs) automatically by analyzing the
 original data source and incorporating constraints manually derived from
 requirements. Next, the IDMs are used to create test data sets that
 achieve t-way coverage, which has shown to be very effective in
 detecting software faults. The generated test data sets also satisfy all
 the constraints identified in the first step. To avoid creating IDMs
 from scratch when there is a change to the original data source or
 constraints, our approach extends the original IDMs with additional
 information. The new IDMs, which we refer to as Adaptive IDMs (AIDMs),
 are updated by comparing the changes against the additional information,
 and are then used to generate new test data sets. We implement our
 approach in a tool, called comBinatorial bIg daTa Test dAta Generator
 (BIT-TAG).
 Our experience shows that combinatorial testing can be effectively
 applied to big data applications. In particular, the test data sets
 created using our approach for the two ETL applications are only a small
 fraction of the original data source, but we were able to detect all the
 faults found with the original data source.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Model-based testers design tests in terms of models, such as paths in
 graphs. This results in abstract tests, which have to be converted to
 concrete tests because the abstract tests use names and events that
 exist in the model, but not the implementation. Model elements often
 appear in many abstract tests, so testers write the same redundant code
 many times. However, many existing model-based testing techniques are
 very complicated to use in practice, especially in agile software
 development. Thus, testers usually have to transform abstract tests to
 concrete tests by hand. This is time-consuming, laborintensive, and
 error-prone.
 This paper presents a language to automate the creation of mappings from
 abstract tests to concrete tests. Three issues are addressed: (1)
 creating mappings and generating test values, (2) transforming graphs
 and using coverage criteria to generate test paths, and (3) solving
 constraints and generating concrete tests.
 Based on the language, we developed a test automation language
 framework. The paper also presents results from an empirical comparison
 of testers using the framework with manual mapping on 11 open source and
 6 example programs. We found that the automated test generation method
 took 29.6\% of the time the manual method took on average, and the
 manual tests contained 48 errors in which concrete tests did not match
 their abstract tests while the automatic tests had zero errors.}},

 network ossification. Network function virtualization (NFV) is proposed
 to address these issues by implementing network functions as pure

 provisioning, deployment, and centralized management of virtual network
 functions. Integrated with SDN, the software-defined NFV architecture
 further offers agile traffic steering and joint optimization of network
 functions and resources. This architecture benefits a wide range of
 applications (e.g., service chaining) and is becoming the dominant form
 of NFV. In this survey, we present a thorough investigation of the
 development of NFV under the software-defined NFV architecture, with an
 emphasis on service chaining as its application. We first introduce the
 software-defined NFV architecture as the state of the art of NFV and
 present relationships between NFV and SDN. Then, we provide a historic
 view of the involvement from middlebox to NFV. Finally, we introduce
 significant challenges and relevant solutions of NFV, and discuss its
 future research directions by different application domains.}},

 place. In this context, the success of enterprises depends critically on

 presented in this paper aims at the assistance of teams following these
 processes. The underlying idea is to help team members in their daily
 tasks in order to be more efficient according to a specific process. The
 two main components of the approach are: an ontology for business
 processes modeling and a Multi-Agent System for providing intelligent
 assistance to the human workers. The Scrum software development process
 illustrates this approach. Scrum is an agile software-development
 process widely used in software companies. This paper introduces a
 specific intelligent assistance software that aims to assist Scrum
 project teams in their implementation of the Scrum process. This tool
 aims primarily at helping Scrum Masters to take decisions by monitoring
 Scrum project teams' activities with their various projects and
 collecting knowledge about these activities. The proposed Scrum tool is
 a web-based system, which uses Multi-Agent System and the
 conceptualization of the Scrum process with a specific ontology.}},

 providers across Europe in the context of experiment requirements. The
 first section will review the architectural changes that a service
 running in the cloud needs, such an orchestration service or new storage

 companies are interested in the adoption of agile methodologies.
 Although Scrum is a light process and easy to understand, its adoption
 sometimes is difficult. Agile methodologies are not obvious by
 themselves, so they are difficult to introduce in the culture of a
 company. In order to identify the problems presented during the
 adoption, a Systematic Literature Review is performed focusing in Scrum.
 We found several problems; these are categorized in four groups: people,

 Sprints, report our results and communicate our progress to customers.
 By providing guidance and evidence of success in these areas we hope to
 overcome real and perceived obstacles that may limit the adoption of
 Lean/Agile techniques in research-oriented development environments.}},

 AQUSA detects quality defects and suggest possible remedies. We describe

 principles emphasize collaboration between software development and

 customers. The techniques may also offer opportunities for continuous
 product improvement when adopted in the embedded systems domain.
 However, certain characteristics of embedded software development
 present obstacles for DevOps adoption, and as yet, there is no empirical
 evidence of its adoption in the embedded systems domain. In this study,
 we present the challenges for DevOps adoption in embedded systems using
 a multiple-case study approach with four companies. The contribution of
 this paper is to introduce the concept of DevOps adoption in the

  Abstract                 = {{Recent technologies enable electronic and RF circuits in communication
 devices and radar to be miniaturized and become physically smaller in
 size. Antenna design has been one of the key limiting constraints to the
 development of small communication terminals and also in meeting next
 generation and radar requirements. Multiple antenna technologies (MATs)
 have gained much attention in the last few years because of the huge
 gain. MATs can enhance the reliability and the channel capacity levels.
 Furthermore, multiple antenna systems can have a big contribution to
 reduce the interference both in the uplink and the downlink. To increase
 the communication systems reliability, multiple antennas can be
 installed at the transmitter or/and at the receiver. The idea behind
 multiple antenna diversity is to supply the receiver by multiple
 versions of the same signal transmitted via independent channels. In
 modern communication transceiver and radar systems, primary aims are to
 direct high power RF signal from transmitter to antenna while preventing
 leakage of that large signal into more sensitive frontend of receiver.
 So, a Single-Pole Double-Throw (SPDT) Transmitter/Receiver (T/R) Switch
 plays an important role. In this paper, design of smart distributed
 subarray MIMO (DSMIMO) microstrip antenna system with controller unit
 and frequency agile has been introduced and investigated. All the entire
 proposed antenna system has been evaluated using a commercial software.
 The final proposed design has been fabricated and the radiation
 characteristics have been illustrated using network analyzer to meet the
 requirements for communication and radar applications.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe an optimization
 approach to maximize collaboration in software process composition. The
 research question is: how to compose a process for a specific software
 development project context aiming to maximize collaboration among team
 members? The optimization approach uses heuristic search algorithms to
 navigate the solution space and look for acceptable solutions.
 Design/methodology/approach: The process composition approach was
 evaluated through an experimental study conducted in the context of a
 large oil company in Brazil. The objective was to evaluate the
 feasibility of composing processes for three software development
 projects. We have also compared genetic algorithm (GA) and hill climbing
 (HC) algorithms driving the optimization with a simple random search
 (RS) in order to determine which would be more effective in addressing
 the problem. In addition, human specialist point-of-view was explored to
 verify if the composed processes were in accordance with his/her
 expectations regarding size, complexity, diversity, and reasonable
 sequence of components.
 Findings: The main findings indicate that GA is more effective (best
 results regarding the fitness function) than HC and RS in the search of
 solutions for collaboration optimization in software process composition
 for large instances. However, all algorithms are competitive for small
 instances and even brute force can be a feasible alternative in such a
 context. These SBSE results were complemented by the feedback given by
 specialist, indicating his satisfaction with the correctness, diversity,
 adherence to the project context, and support to the project manager
 during the decision making in process composition.
 Research limitations: This work was evaluated in the context of a single
 company and used only three project instances. Due to confidentiality
 restrictions, the data describing these instances could not be disclosed
 to be used in other research works. The reduced size of the sample
 prevents generalization for other types of projects or different
 contexts.
 Implications: This research is important for practitioners who are
 facing challenges to handle diversity in software process definition,
 since it proposes an approach based on context, reuse and process
 composition. It also contributes to research on collaboration by
 presenting a collaboration management solution (COMPOOTIM) that includes
 both an approach to introduce collaboration in organizations through
 software processes and a collaboration measurement strategy. From the
 standpoint of software engineering looking for collaborative solutions
 in distributed software development, free/open source software, agile,
 and ecosystems initiatives, the results also indicate how to increase
 collaboration in software development.
 Originality/value: This work proposes a systematic strategy to manage
 collaboration in software development process composition. Moreover, it
 brings together a mix of computer-oriented and human-oriented studies on
 the search-based software engineering (SBSE) research area. Finally,
 this work expands the body of knowledge in SBSE to the field of software
 process which has not been properly explored by former research. (C)

  Abstract                 = {{IT executives initiate software development process methodology change
 with faith that it will lower development cost, decrease time-to-market
 and increase quality. Anecdotes and success stories from agile
 practitioners and vendors provide evidence that other companies have
 succeeded following a newly chosen doctrine. Quantitative evidence is
 scarcer than these stories, and when available, often unverifiable.
 This paper introduces a quantitative approach to assess software process
 methodology change. It proposes working from the perspective of impact
 on cycle-time performance (the time from the start of individual pieces
 of work until their completion), before and after a process change.
 This paper introduces the history and theoretical basis of this
 analysis, and then presents a commercial case study. The case study
 demonstrates how the economic value of a process change initiative was
 quantified to understand success and payoff.
 Cycle-time is a convenient metric for comparing proposed and ongoing
 process improvement due to its easy capture and applicability to all
 processes. Poor cycle-time analysis can lead to teams being held to
 erroneous service level expectations. Properly comparing the impact of
 proposed process change scenarios, modeled using historical or estimated
 cycle-time performance helps isolate the bottom line impact of process
 changes with quantitative rigor.}},

 Objective: This study sets out to answer the following research
 question: What is the current state of integration between agile
 processes and usability techniques? Method: We conduct a systematic
 mapping study (SMS). A SMS is a form of systematic literature review
 that aims to identify and classify the research papers published about a
 specified issue. Results: We retrieved a total of 31 primary studies,
 suggesting that the agile development community is starting to adopt
 some usability techniques in its development projects. Most of the
 human-computer interaction (HCI) techniques that the ASDP is adopting
 are techniques related to requirements engineering, especially
 techniques for requirements elicitation and analysis. Judging by the
 increase in the number of publications over the last decade, the
 integration of HCI activities and techniques into the ASDP is an issue
 of notable interest. Conclusions: There are few papers that study the
 literature holistically and report the current state of usability in the
 ASDP. Additionally, the literature does not contain a general, formal

 development process (ASDP) and user-centred design (UCD) has grown over
 the last decade. However, there are not many papers that study this
 issue holistically and uncover the current state of this integration.
 Aim: This study sets out to answer the following research question: What
 is the current state of integration between agile processes and
 usability? Method: We conduct a systematic mapping study (SMS). A SMS is
 a form of systematic literature review that aims to identify and
 classify the research papers published about a specified issue. Results:
 We retrieved a total of 161 primary studies, which we categorized
 according to four criteria: process, practice, team and technology
 integration. The largest group refers to process integration with a
 total of 76 primary studies. Judging by the increase in the number of
 publications over the last decade, the integration of human-computer
 interaction (HCI) activities and techniques into the ASDP is an issue of
 notable interest. Conclusions: There are very few papers that study the
 literature holistically and report the current state of usability in the
 ASDP. Additionally, there are no formalized proposals for adopting
 usability techniques in ASDP.}},

 organizations rooted in traditional ``Waterfall{''} software development
 employed heavy upfront project design and limited changes and feedback
 during and between project stages. Waterfall methods make heavy use of
 outcome controls primarily monitored by the information systems function
 (ISF). This paper explores the control mechanisms used by the ISF and
 business function (BF) during and after the introduction of a major
 Agile project at a large U.S. company steeped in the traditional
 Waterfall method. Outcome control, the predominant control mechanism
 used in the case company, gave way to a hybrid-like control that
 possessed mechanisms of emergent control while maintaining vestiges of
 some Waterfall-like outcome control. We observed that, prior to the
 introduction of Agile, the software-development process was firmly in
 the hands of the ISF. The introduction of Agile shifted some of the
 controller authority over the development process from the ISF to the
 BF. Lessons learned from the case study point to the complexity of
 designing control mechanisms during a transition from the Waterfall
 method to an Agile approach.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Reliable and secure wireless communications is fundamental to
 connectivity between smarter gadgets and people. This is much more true
 in defence applications with its unique requirements and challenges.
 Broadly the data link requirements in defence applications are seen
 under two categories. One, robust fool-proof zero downtime data links
 for telemetry, command and control. Second, broad band data links for
 data streaming and high bandwidth information exchanges. The data link
 platforms offered for these applications must therefore address the need
 to quickly prototype waveforms, be easy for field and use-case tests,
 support quick means for security layer add-ons and easily be amenable to
 technology adoption, ruggedization and deployment. This paper describes
 some of the challenges of design and prototyping for defence
 applications and presents how agile systems built with the right choice
 of design partition and architecture choices with hardware, software and
 waveforms can be cognizant of the challenges of the defence applications
 and illustrates few example cases with simulations and real field
 deployment trials. It is envisaged that the Agile Cognizant Transceiver
 (ACT) platform built, helps faster prototyping of defence systems and
 paves the way for faster product induction cycles in defence automation.}},

 methodology, the requirements of the target methodology are captured as
 Features. First introduced in the agile FDD (Feature-Driven Development)
 methodology, Features are fully object-oriented and provide all the
 benefits that the object-oriented paradigm has to offer. Due to the
 object-oriented nature of Features and the rest of its deliverables, our
 proposed Feature-Driven Methodology Development (FDMD) process is fully
 seamless; this also facilitates the development of tool support for the

 visualization of the workflow and limitation of the work in progress.
 Kanban concepts are introduced in two ways: in combination with Scrum
 (as Scrumban) or as a ``pure{''} Kanban (omitting some of the Scrum
 activities considered waste). Students are required to work in teams
 responsible for the implementation of a set of user stories defined by a
 project domain expert playing the role of the Product Owner. During the
 course, they must maintain a Kanban board and measure lead time. The
 paper discusses the use of different Kanban boards and work in progress
 limits, and analyzes the students' progress in reducing lead time. A
 summary of the lessons learned and recommendations is given reflecting
 the issues to be considered when teaching similar courses. A survey
 among students has shown that they liked both approaches and were
 overwhelmingly positive about the course.}},

 introduction of agile methods like Scrum. Apart from exposing students
 to state-of-the-art topics, the capstone course also enables teachers to

 researchers opportunities to conduct empirical studies with students as
 subjects. In order to satisfy the needs of all parties involved, a good
 computerized support tool is needed. The students need such a tool to
 manage their projects, the teachers require instruments for maintaining
 project requirements and monitoring student progress, while the
 researchers are interested in data for evidence-driven assessment of the
 development process. In this paper, an example of such a tool that was
 developed to support a Scrum-based software engineering capstone course
 is described. The course design, which requires students to develop a
 quasi-real project, is described first. Following this, a step-by-step
 description of the course execution is provided and the tool support of
 each step is illustrated. Finally, the opinions of 57 students obtained
 through an anonymous survey after using the tool for the first time are
 analyzed. The students found the tool intuitive and easy to use,
 providing good visualization of the project progress and making the
 execution of their projects simpler and more efficient. The tool gives
 directions on how their collaboration should proceed and prevents them
 from exploring their projects blindly. By visualizing the development
 process, it helps all parties involved to know what each team member is
 doing, thus preventing procrastination and ``free-rider{''} syndrome.}},

 help of an automated toolchain from code to delivery.
 Objective: We investigate, which tools are used in software delivery,
 what are the reasons omitting certain parts of the toolchain and what
 implications toolchains have on how rapidly software gets delivered to
 customers.
 Method: We present a multiple-case study of the toolchains currently in
 use in Finnish software-intensive organizations interested in improving
 their delivery frequency. We conducted qualitative semi-structured
 interviews in 18 case organizations from various software domains. The
 interviewees were key representatives of their organization, considering
 delivery activities.
 Results: Commodity tools, such as version control and continuous
 integration, were used in almost every organization. Modestly used
 tools, such as UI testing and performance testing, were more distinctly
 missing from some organizations. Uncommon tools, such as artifact
 repository and acceptance testing, were used only in a minority of the
 organizations. Tool usage is affected by the state of current
 work-flows, manual work and relevancy of tools. Organizations whose
 toolchains were more automated and contained fewer manual steps were
 able to deploy software more rapidly.
 Conclusions: There is variety in the need for tool support in different
 development steps as there are domain-specific differences in the goals
 of the case organizations. Still, a well-founded toolchain supports
 speedy delivery of new software. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  Abstract                 = {{In software development project, cost management has been identified as
 one of the challenges aspect should be faced by the project community.
 Poor cost management will affect the software projects such as project
 delay and cost overrun. Therefore, his paper tries to look into the
 issues and challenges faced by the Project Manager when they manage a
 cost in agile software development project. In this paper, qualitative
 approach was employed. 10 project managers that have been dealing with
 cost management process were interviewed. Results from the interviews
 had indicated that top five issues and challenges that have been
 highlighted by the project managers such as lack of expertise in agile,
 unavailability of computerised tools, reasons for adopting agile in cost
 management {[}is this a challenge?], success factors and lack of real
 commitment. However, the most critical issue is the unavailability of
 computerised tools which lead to the ineffectiveness of cost management
 activities. It is concluded that nonetheless, it is important to
 highlight the issues and challenges of agile cost management in order to
 prevent cost overrun and the ineffectiveness in managing the cost. One
 of the important issues is the unavailability of computerised tool to
 help project managers in managing a cost. The computerised tool is
 important not only for experienced project manager but also to the new
 project managers. They can simply use the tool without having much
 experience.}},

 study on Mozilla Firefox, and performs a semi-systematic literature
 review. The case study analyzes the results of 312,502 execution runs of
 the 1,547 mostly manual system-level test cases of Mozilla Firefox from
 2006 to 2012 (5 major traditional and 9 major rapid releases), and
 triangulates our findings with a Mozilla QA engineer. We find that rapid
 releases have a narrower test scope that enables a deeper investigation
 of the features and regressions with the highest risk. Furthermore,
 rapid releases make testing more continuous and have proportionally
 smaller spikes before the main release. However, rapid releases make it
 more difficult to build a large testing community , and they decrease
 test suite diversity and make testing more deadline oriented. In
 addition, our semi-systematic literature review presents the benefits,
 problems and enablers of rapid releases from 24 papers found using
 systematic search queries and a similar amount of papers found through
 other means. The literature review shows that rapid releases are a
 prevalent industrial practice that are utilized even in some highly
 critical domains of software engineering, and that rapid releases
 originated from several software development methodologies such as
 agile, open source, lean and internet-speed software development.
 However, empirical studies proving evidence of the claimed advantages
 and disadvantages of rapid releases are scarce.}},

 continuous advancements in the field of Software development

 over 30 years offering a sequential and linear development approach.
 However, the impending issues with regards to CTQ have led to rise of
 agile development methodologies in last couple of decades offering
 incremental \& iterative development, customer collaboration and reduced
 time to market. The new agile paradigm, on the other side, is also
 bringing its own challenges and risks primarily in terms of runtime
 infrastructure cost, network accessibility and platform availability
 steering towards CTQ issues in a disguised manner. With Cloud Computing
 gaining popularity over the last few years offering almost zero CAPEX
 (Capital Expenditure), reduced OPEX (Operational Expenditure), high
 scalability \& availability, it has been considered worthwhile to
 explore Agile based software development on Cloud. In this article,
 migration of Agile based project to Cloud has been discussed along with
 its benefits and challenges at both the stages. While Cloud adoption is
 a catalyst for Agile based development, there are a few open issues to
 be addressed.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The adoption of Agile Software Development in large companies is a
 recent phenomenon of great interest both for researchers and
 practitioners. Although intra-team interaction is well supported by
 established agile practices, the critical interaction between the agile
 team and other parts of the organization is still unexplored in
 literature. Such interactions slow down the development, hindering the
 achievement of business goals based on speed: short time to market,
 quick replication of products of a product-line, and reaction time for
 product evolution. We have employed a two-year long multiple-case
 case-study, collecting data through interviews and a survey in three
 large companies developing embedded software. Through a combination of
 qualitative and quantitative analysis, we have found strong evidence
 that interaction challenges between the development team and other
 groups in the organization hinder speed and are widespread in the
 organizations. This paper also identifies current practices in use at
 the studied companies and provides detailed guidelines for novel
 solutions in the investigated domain. Such practices are called
 boundary-spanning activities in information system research and
 coordination theory. We present a comparison between large embedded
 software companies employing agile and developing a line of products
 based on reused assets and agile companies developing pure software. We
 highlight specific contextual factors and areas where novel spanning
 activities are needed for mitigating the interaction challenges

 produce software. There is a myriad of agile processes and methodologies
 now available for any software development organization to choose from.
 These agile processes follow the values signed in the Agile Manifesto
 that preaches the exaltation of the individual programmer, high
 feedback, customer interaction and just enough planning and
 documentation. But how does global distribution affect these values? Can
 agile software development be implemented under the global software
 development context? This paper presents a systematic literature review
 aimed at identifying factors that affect the adoption of agile factors
 in global distributed teams. Our findings show that the literature is
 still in its initial case study publication stage. But most notably, we
 have found that only a few of the factors found are related to the agile
 values. Even though more research is clearly needed, this can be a
 signal that the factors affecting team distribution has more impact on
 software development than the values and practices preached by the agile
 processes.}},

 adherence to agile practices in teams. The metrics identify instances in
 development data, e.g. commits or user stories, where agile processes
 were not followed. The identified violations can serve as starting
 points for further investigation and team discussions. With contextual
 knowledge of the violation, the executed process or the metric itself
 can be refined. The metrics reflect our experiences with running a
 software engineering course over the last five years. They measure
 aspects which students frequently have issues with and that diminish
 process adoption and student engagement. We present the proposed
 metrics, which were tested in the latest course installment, alongside

 One of the major changes has been imposed by the need to include

 there are many successful implementation stories the Italian Army
 experience and clearly show there is more conceptual work to be done.
 There are a number of open issues to be tackled and a growth potential
 to be exploited. AMINSEP tackles the area of monitoring and measuring
 using noninvasive tools (Italian Army choice) necessary to keep high the
 product quality level and monitor criticalities. Those tools need to
 evolve. The evolution has to take into account the peculiar environment
 of the agile teams. The current tools are based on complexity metrics
 borne for the old fashion software factories. The collected data do not

 practice software process improvement activities even if they do see the
 topics covered in their course lectures and textbooks. Serious games are
 gaining popularity as a means of instruction in higher education. Some
 excellent prescriptive software process simulation games have been
 created, as well as a few software engineering drill and practice games.
 In general, these games do not allow students to create agile process
 models or experiment with process improvement strategies. We are
 creating a serious game that will serve as a virtual learning
 environment to allow students to explore agile process improvement
 practices. Our game is designed as a single player game where the player
 takes the role of software team leader and plays against an AI
 (artificial intelligence) opponent representing the customer's interests
 and needs. Players are rewarded for developing project strategies that
 allow for completion of projects on time, within budget, and meet the

  Abstract                 = {{Software as a Service (SaaS), a type of cloud computing is based on
 information technology (IT) capabilities in a utility model that
 enhances the reliability and scalability at relatively low costs as
 compared to on-premise IT systems. Other benefits SaaS provides to
 customers include: no upfront investment cost required, elasticity of
 computing resources, vendor support and upgrades, agile response to
 markets, usage metered as utility, resource pooling the ability to add
 computing resources as needed. Consequently, organisations may decide to
 adopt SaaS model based on these potential benefits. However, these
 benefits may have some implications on the roles of IT workers and
 functions of IT department. These implications include: changing IT
 workers' skill sets requirements, widespread of layoffs of hardware IT
 workers, and IT department loses control of IT-Servers, and focuses more
 on data security, vendor management, as IT system support moves to cloud
 service provider. Similarly, IT workers believe that turning IT resource
 and support to a cloud service provider poses significant risks to their
 own jobs {[}1]. There is a lack of research conducted on the
 implications of SaaS model on IT department and associated human
 resource management. Thus, this paper seeks to fill this gap by
 examining how SaaS adoption may change IT workers' roles and tasks, and
 functions of IT department. Drawing on adaptive structuration theory, a
 modified framework is constructed to support the change dynamics from
 SaaS adoption. Using examples of functions of IT department in tertiary
 institutions, we explored sources of structures from advanced IT and the
 ways in which organisational and human interactions have an impact on
 how SaaS is appropriated and institutionalised into business processes,
 and brings about changes in an organisation. This paper contributes to
 the theory by examining the way emergent and new structures are
 formulated at the macro and group level of the organisational structure.
 Implications for researchers and practitioners are provided.}},

 complexity in software systems and how a probe - sense - learn approach

 complex systems and a sense - analyse - learn approach is appropriate
 for developing a complicated system whose design has been determined. We
 then examine how quality assurance is incorporated into agile software
 development before pointing out that those characteristics of a
 self-managed team that produce so many benefits for software development
 of complex systems whose solution evolves with problem understanding,
 are also vulnerable to confirmation bias. This suggests that for safety
 critical system development, software systems developed by agile teams
 will need verification and validation by independent parties. We review
 current quality management practices for medical device software
 development before discussing how our earlier findings could be adopted
 into safety critical software quality management.}},

 adopted, to what success. This mapping study revealed that incorporating
 agile practices with the existing plan driven SDLC is the most

 contradictory to regulatory requirements, insufficient coverage of risk

  Abstract                 = {{Network function virtualization (NFV) decouples software implementations
 of network functions from their hosts (or hardware). NFV exposes a new
 set of entities, the virtualized network functions (VNFs). The VNFs can
 be chained with other VNFs and physical network functions to realize
 network services. This flexibility introduced by NFV allows service
 providers to respond in an agile manner to variable service demands and
 changing business goals. In this context, the efficient establishment of
 service chains and their placement becomes essential to reduce capital
 and operational expenses and gain in service agility. This paper
 addresses the placement aspect of these service chains by finding the
 best locations and hosts for the VNFs and to steer traffic across these
 functions while respecting user requirements and maximizing provider
 revenue. We propose a novel eigendecomposition-based approach for the
 placement of virtual and physical network function chains in networks
 and cloud environments. A heuristic based on a custom greedy algorithm
 is also presented to compare performance and assess the capability of
 the eigendecomposition approach. The performance of both algorithms is
 compared to a multi-stage-based method from the state of the art that
 also addresses the chaining of network services. Performance evaluation
 results show that our matrix-based method, eigendecomposition of
 adjacency matrices, has reduced complexity and convergence times that
 essentially depend only on the physical graph sizes. Our proposal also
 outperforms the related work in provider's revenue and acceptance rate.}},

 software was not easy and implied the generation of a brand new
 ``agile{''} methodology called: Italian Army Agile or ITA2. Setting up
 the LC2Evo ( the evolution software of the land C2) implied the solution
 of many problems and the construction of a solid structure based on four
 ``pillars{''}: User Community Governance, Specific ``agile{''} Training,
 new ``agile{''} CASE1 Tools, custom ``agile{''} development doctrine.
 This paper gives a short description of the Italian C2 software
 evolution from the current SIACCON2 to the LC2Evo whose first components
 are in use already in various national and out of area operations. The
 LC2Evo ``dismounted Soldier segment software using augmented reality and
 goggle glass-like display is also described. The major problems tackled
 and solved for the construction of the ``four pillars{''} are treated.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A successful Agile adoption requires ongoing engagement from everyone
 involved, including team members, managers and executive leadership.
 Social systems are complex adaptive systems that generate complicated
 and non-linear feedback. Engagement is an emergent property of social
 systems, and essential for effective and lasting Agile adoptions. This
 property does decay quickly, often resulting in poor results in Agile
 adoption efforts. This paper introduces Open Space as a tool that
 functions as a ``event{''} with a ``good game{''} structure for creating
 rapid, effective and lasting Agile adoptions. Actual experience using
 Open Space in Agile adoptions is discussed, including lessons learned.

  Abstract                 = {{Introduction: For many organizations, limited budgets and phased funding
 restrict the development of digital health tools. This problem is often
 exacerbated by the ever-increasing sophistication of technology and
 costs related to programming and maintenance. Traditional development
 methods tend to be costly and inflexible and not client centered. The
 purpose of this study is to analyze the use of Agile software
 development and outcomes of a three-phase mHealth program designed to
 help young adult Quebecers quit smoking.
 Methods: In Phase I, literature reviews, focus groups, interviews, and
 behavior change theory were used in the adaption and re-launch of an
 existing evidence-based mHealth platform. Based on analysis of user
 comments and utilization data from Phase I, the second phase expanded
 the service to allow participants to live text-chat with counselors.
 Phase II evaluation led to the third and current phase, in which
 algorithms were introduced to target pregnant smokers, substance users,
 students, full-time workers, those affected by mood disorders and
 chronic disease.
 Results: Data collected throughout the three phases indicate that the
 incremental evolution of the intervention has led to increasing numbers
 of smokers being enrolled while making functional enhancements. In Phase
 I (240 days) 182 smokers registered with the service. 51\% (n = 94) were
 male and 61.5\% (n = 112) were between the ages of 18-24. In Phase II
 (300 days), 994 smokers registered with the service. 51\% (n = 508) were
 male and 41\% (n = 403) were between the ages of 18-24. At 174 days to
 date 873 smokers have registered in the third phase. 44\% (n = 388) were
 male and 24\% (n = 212) were between the ages of 18-24.
 Conclusions: Emerging technologies in behavioral science show potential,
 but do not have defined best practices for application development. In
 phased-based projects with limited funding, Agile appears to be a viable
 approach to building and expanding digital tools.}},

 facilitates a thorough understanding of cognitive support requirements
 from an end user perspective as a foundation for design. In this
 project, we used an iterative design process, including ethnographic
 observation and cognitive task analysis, to move from an initial design
 concept to a working modular software application called the Screening
 \& Surveillance App. The beta version is tailored to work with the
 Veterans Health Administration's EHR Computerized Patient Record System
 (CPRS). Primary care providers using the beta version Screening \&
 Surveillance App more accurately answered questions about patients and
 found relevant information more quickly compared to those using CPRS
 alone. Primary care providers also reported reduced mental effort and
 rated the Screening \& Surveillance App positively for usability.}},

 The methodologies and tools architecting distributed enterprise resource

 attacks. This paper aims at identifying some of critical privacy issues
 by collecting data from ERP practitioners. This work models variables
 associated with ERP with the variables of privacy to establish a robust
 adoption of ERP practices. Privacy issues concerning ERP are listed.
 Several variables associated with the development, implementation, and
 control of ERP are identified in the existing literature. A
 questionnaire instrument was distributed among a set of ERP
 practitioners. The response data collected thereby were analyzed
 statistically. Based upon the statistical analysis, an attempt has been
 made in the paper to make a ranking of the privacy factors. The
 observations are discussed in detail, and some specific conclusions have

  Abstract                 = {{This paper presents an exploration into the potency of a software
 development course at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology
 (CPUT), with particular emphasis on whether it adequately facilitates a
 realisation of the operational needs of the agile software development
 industry. Using the qualitative research methods within the interpretive
 research paradigm, software development organisations in Cape Town
 (Western Cape), Port Elizabeth (Eastern Cape) and Johannesburg (Gauteng)
 were selected and observed. In this process, a description of a final
 year graduate software development programme, five Scrum teams operating
 in different environments and two academics from one academic
 institution were interviewed. In addition, Structuration Theory (ST) was
 used as an analytical framework and an analytical tool.
 The findings show a discrepancy between the academic curriculum and the
 industry practices. At first glance, the curriculum appeared to serve as
 a prescriptive guide, embedded with rules such as standards, guidelines
 and practices. In practice however, rules were not as strictly applied
 in scrum as in traditional methodologies. Instead, it was developer
 skills, the type and size of the project that had a direct influence on
 the practice/s. Whilst resources such as time as well as the skills of
 developers and Scrum leaders emerged as the most central aspects of the
 scrum process, it also became clear that Scrum has its unique form of
 quality assurance in the software development practice. Rather than a
 religious adherence sequential software development life cycle phases
 and compliance to the standards, unit testing, user acceptance testing,
 close collaboration and code reviews were perceived as the most
 important practices in Scrum projects. The destination seems more
 important than the journey in scrum projects. That is, as long as the
 customer deadlines are met - the throughput rate is more important that
 the process. In view of the findings, recommendations can be summed up
 into 4 main points; (1) that to ensure quality assurance in Scrum, Scrum
 teams, especially team leaders, should enforce compliance to standards,
 regardless of time pressures and tight deadlines; (2) It seems that the
 practice of working with the client to test final products as a quality
 assurance mechanism is working for all parties. This practice is
 encouraged and must be maintained; (3) Code reviews must be enforced,
 and that organizations invest in resources including the constant
 training of developers; (4) Project product owners, project managers,
 team leaders and business analysts should regularly meet with the user
 to verify requirements prior to the implementation phase. Active
 stakeholder involvement can minimize development costs and time. As much
 as a discrepancy between academic focus of quality assurance procedures
 is evident, emphasis on quality assurance remain significant as they
 sensitize learners of quality approach to software development.}},

 face-to-face interactions. An interpretative qualitative approach using
 case studies has been adopted to gain deeper insights into how such
 teams work. The analysis is being informed by theoretical concepts of
 awareness, common ground and boundary objects. Early findings suggest
 that distributed team members use multifaceted techniques, such as
 shared software artifacts that evolve over time to negotiate and enhance
 common ground for better collaborative practices to emerge. It is
 expected that research undertaken will provide a framework to understand
 this process. Practically, the research will propose guidelines for

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Testing complex industrial robots (CIRs) requires testing
 several interacting control systems. This is challenging, especially for
 robots performing process-intensive tasks such as painting or gluing,
 since their dedicated process control systems can be loosely coupled
 with the robot's motion control.
 Objective: Current practices for validating CIRs involve manual test
 case design and execution. To reduce testing costs and improve quality
 assurance, a trend is to automate the generation of test cases. Our work
 aims to define a cost-effective automated testing technique to validate
 CIR control systems in an industrial context.
 Method: This paper reports on a methodology, developed at ABB Robotics
 in collaboration with SIMULA, for the fully automated testing of CIRs
 control systems. Our approach draws on continuous integration principles
 and well-established constraint-based testing techniques. It is based on
 a novel constraint-based model for automatically generating test
 sequences where test sequences are both generated and executed as part
 of a continuous integration process.
 Results: By performing a detailed analysis of experimental results over
 a simplified version of our constraint model, we determine the most
 appropriate parameterization of the operational version of the
 constraint model. This version is now being deployed at ABB Robotics's
 CIR testing facilities and used on a permanent basis. This paper
 presents the empirical results obtained when automatically generating
 test sequences for CIRs at ABB Robotics. In a real industrial setting,
 the results show that our methodology is not only able to detect
 reintroduced known faults, but also to spot completely new faults.
 Conclusion: Our empirical evaluation shows that constraint-based testing
 is appropriate for automatically generating test sequences for CIRs and
 can be faithfully deployed in an industrial context. (C) 2014 Elsevier

 launched a systematic mapping study and conducted a thematic analysis of
 the results. Moreover, we analyzed the strength of the evidence in the
 light of a rigor and relevance assessment of the research. We identified
 33 publications, divided into 9 themes related to OI. 17/33 studies fall
 in the high-rigor/high-relevance category, suggesting the results are
 highly industry relevant. The research indicates that start-ups have
 higher tendency to opt for OI compared to incumbents. The evidence also
 suggests that firms assimilating knowledge into their internal R\&D
 activities, have higher likelihood of gaining financial advantages. We
 concluded that OI should be adopted as a complementary approach to
 facilitate internal innovation and not to substitute it. Further
 research is advised on situated OI strategies and the interplay between
 OI and agile practices.}},

 why there are no universal development processes that can be applied

 Proponents of agile development methodologies are often against the
 concept of branching as a matter of principle, other large software

 control the software generated by thousands of its engineers.
 Microsoft is migrating its development processes to be able to
 simultaneously produce software as both stand-alone products and as a
 SAAS (e.g. Windows 8 and Azure), requiring a re-architecture of these
 processes. To fully understand the impact of any changes to their
 development processes the product groups addressed the question of
 whether and how to use branching within its development process. Bases
 on this assessment this talk attempts to go back to first principles in
 regard to software development and shows that there are a lot more
 similarities than differences between agile and non-agile software
 development methods. The talk will also discuss the pros and cons of
 branching identifying where it will positively and negatively impact

  Abstract                 = {{The cost of software development is one of the major contributors to the
 development cost for safety systems in the petrochemical industry. It is
 hard to make developers work faster but it is possible to make them work
 more efficient. One way to achieve that is to introduce agile
 development methods. Agile methods are gaining increasing popularity in
 safety critical areas such as the petrochemical industry. Agile methods
 promise reduced costs and shorter time to market through incremental
 development, less production of unnecessary documents and more
 maintainable code. The IEC 61511: 2003 standard is normally used by the
 petrochemical industry. The second edition of this standard will be
 issued in 2015.
 Both the current and the new draft edition IEC 61511: 2014 of the IEC
 61511 standard are evaluated against agile development approach in this
 paper. Both editions of the IEC 61511 standard have a strong link to IEC
 61508. Manufacturers and suppliers of devices shall use IEC 61508, while
 system designers, integrators and users shall use IEC 61511. The IEC
 61508 standard's relationship to agile development has been evaluated
 with success in a previous paper (Stalhane 2012).
 While the architectural design also in agile development is done up
 front, detailed design is done incrementally. Based on reported
 experiences in other domains, we expect the following benefits:
 Easier to discover and correct faulty or incomplete system requirements
 Simpler software, thus reducing the development and maintenance costs
 Only documents that are needed, either for certification or development,
 are developed The ones that are developed are used and kept up-to-date
 Improved opportunities for reuse and site development.
 The challenge is to introduce agile development without compromising
 safety. Development of safety systems needs to be compliant with IEC
 61511. This standard impose rigor and additional costs, but proper
 adaptation of agile methods can add flexibility and efficiency. In order
 to evaluate this proposition we use a three step process:
 Go through all relevant requirements in the standard and mark all
 requirements as (1) fully met using agile development, (2) possible to
 meet using agile development and (3) cannot be fulfilled ``as is{''}
 using agile development.
 All requirements in category (2) are studied further in order to assign
 them to category (1) - OK, category (2) adaptations to the agile method
 by including add-on's or category (3) - changes to the development
 process.
 Suggest appropriate modifications to the agile development.
 This is the same process that we have used with success for IEC 61508
 (Stalhane 2012) and IEC 60880 (Stalhane 2013). The work on IEC 61508
 resulted in a method called SafeScrum. The SafeScrum model are reused
 and improved to fit the current and new edition of IEC 61511. There are
 no requirements in the current standards that prevents for an adjusted
 agile development process as SafeScrum.
 When the issues identified as category 2 in section 2 are settled, it
 should be straight forward to use SafeScrum and still be IEC 61511
 conformant. It is now important to get one or more companies to try it
 out in cooperation with the certification bodies and / or authorities to
 get a reality check of the concepts discussed. This will allow us to
 identify possible problems and to make the adjustments necessary for
 industrial application. The main challenges are the IEC 61511
 requirements on configuration management, traceability, detailed
 planning and documentation.
 However, in order to reap the full benefits of agile development, it is
 not enough to show conformance to IEC 61511. Suggested improvements of
 IEC 61511 are more requirements and information regarding modern
 software development methods. This is also in accordance with
 preliminary work performed by the current IEC 61508-3 maintenance
 committee.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Enterprise Resource Planning, ERP software has come a long way since its
 inception as Inventory Management and Control Systems of 1960s. The
 value of ERP Implementation Strategy has been stressed over the years
 and it has been included as an important Critical Success Factor, CSF,
 as recorded by previous researchers. Traditional ERP implementation
 followed more or less a sequential approach akin to the Waterfall Model.
 Researchers over the years have categorized ERP Implementation
 methodology and developed frameworks. These are based on varied ERP
 Implementation observations. Given the variety of methodologies and
 frameworks available, the real-world ERP implementation demands the
 development and adoption of a strategy as a guiding principle for
 underlying methods. This paper suggests a new classification approach
 based on the ERP implementation strategy that can be categorized as
 custom-made, vendor-specific or consultant-specific. This research paper
 also conducts a comparative study of leading vendor-specific ERP
 implementation methodologies along-with their example cases. It then
 discusses how the principles of Agile Methodology as laid down in the
 Agile Manifesto {[}1] are being incorporated in ERP implementations.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Background: An incremental, loosely planned development approach is
 often used in bioinformatic studies when dealing with custom data
 analysis in a rapidly changing environment. Unfortunately, the lack of a
 rigorous software structuring can undermine the maintainability,
 communicability and replicability of the process. To ameliorate this
 problem we propose the Leaf system, the aim of which is to seamlessly
 introduce the pipeline formality on top of a dynamical development
 process with minimum overhead for the programmer, thus providing a
 simple layer of software structuring.
 Results: Leaf includes a formal language for the definition of pipelines
 with code that can be transparently inserted into the user's Python
 code. Its syntax is designed to visually highlight dependencies in the
 pipeline structure it defines. While encouraging the developer to think
 in terms of bioinformatic pipelines, Leaf supports a number of automated
 features including data and session persistence, consistency checks
 between steps of the analysis, processing optimization and publication
 of the analytic protocol in the form of a hypertext.
 Conclusions: Leaf offers a powerful balance between plan-driven and
 change-driven development environments in the design, management and
 communication of bioinformatic pipelines. Its unique features make it a
 valuable alternative to other related tools.}},

 test Pair-programming effects on students' behavior and performance in a

 devised an experiment that was carried out over an entire academic year
 consists of two semesters. The experiment targeted two sections per
 semester of an advanced computer programming course. The students of one
 of the sections worked in pairs during the lab sessions, applying
 pair-programming rules and techniques. The other section had students
 who worked individually, as it is the norm in most programming labs.
 Video recordings were recorded throughout the lab sessions, and then
 studied and analyzed. In addition, code samples were collected from the
 students to study the effect of pair-programming on the students' code
 quality. Through this experiment we found out that pair-programming has
 the potential to increase the students' confidence, their enjoyment of
 the course, and improved the course's completion rate. In addition, the
 students in the pair-programming sections showed that they were able to
 individually produce code of better quality than the students in the
 traditional section.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In the context of a fast controller prototype project, which aimed at
 testing the integration of fast plant systems in the ITER software
 environment, a software Quality Assurance (QA) strategy that is
 appropriate for the development of ITER realtime applications (e.g.
 diagnostic control systems) is being developed. In particular the QA
 processes had to be designed in order to safely integrate contributions
 from a large and heterogeneous development community, which includes
 developer profiles both from the scientific community and from the
 industrial suppliers. Notably the coding standard aims at demonstrating
 MISRA-C++: 2008 compliance.
 The MARTe software framework is currently being used to implement a
 large variety of fusion real-time control system applications. Being a
 modular and multi-platform framework has allowed to reuse components,
 interfaces and services across systems which are deployed in very
 distinct architectures. This has leveraged the exposure of the same code
 to different environment configurations, thus increasing the confidence
 on its quality and robustness.
 The QA processes are being applied to the development of a new version
 of the MARTe framework. The main objective is to provide a QA
 certifiable environment from where it is possible to develop, with less
 effort, certifiable applications. This is expected to be achieved by
 sharing the same QA methodologies and tools and by maximising the reuse
 of framework modules (which were also developed against these QA
 processes).
 This paper details the QA processes, the associated tools and discusses
 its applicability to the fusion development environment.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Organisations and end-users are increasingly using Cloud resources to
 take advantage of the anticipated benefits of a more cost effective and
 agile IT infrastructure. Virtual machines are provisioned based on a
 selection of available images, which often contain the operating system
 and the software stack required by applications. When managing an image
 library, some of the challenges faced by a resource provider include (i)
 identifying the optimal number of virtual machine images that satisfy
 most user requirements, and (ii) bundling software systems into images
 to minimise the time to provision virtual machines and ease the
 selection of images from an end-user's perspective. Using a traditional
 data centre workload, this paper proposes an algorithm for selecting
 software bundles for virtual machine images and examines the impact of
 bundle selection on the number and characteristics of resulting images.
 The main finding is that creating a small set of virtual machine images
 packed with the most popular software systems is enough to drastically
 reduce the time to deploy the software stack required by applications,
 and hence minimise the time for provisioning virtual servers in a Cloud
 infrastructure.}},

 (KM) can be apprehended in two manners: the defensive manner builds the
 stock of knowledge to face the departures of personnel, or, the
 offensive manner sees in the knowledge development an advisability to
 generate new products. The link between PLM and KM is interesting as it
 can help answering ``on field{''} problems. In this paper we first make
 a state of the art of knowledge and KM in a PLM context. Then we propose

 Since the introduction of the Agile Manifesto in 2001, several agile

 larger multi-team set-ups for complex Information Technology (IT) system
 development. However, the adoption of agile methods has been slow in the
 public sector. This is also reflected in the academic literature, as
 there are only a few studies discussing agile adoption in public
 organizations. This paper contributes to research on the use of agile
 practices specifically in the context of public organizations, and sheds
 light on the challenges a public organization may face while adopting
 these practices. The aim of this paper is to identify and categorize the
 challenges that may hinder efficient adoption and use of agile methods
 in public IT projects that include private software vendors. This
 research is based on a case study of a large governmental office. As a
 result, this paper presents several categories of identified challenges,
 the root causes of these challenges, and a discussion of the
 characteristics of these challenges for the public sector.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Ward Cunningham in his experience report presented at the OOPSLA'92
 conference introduced the metaphor of technical debt. This metaphor is
 related to immature, incomplete or inadequate artifacts in the software
 development cycle that cause higher costs and lower quality. A strategy
 for the technical debt management is still a challenge because its
 definition is not yet part of the software development process. Carolyn
 Seaman and Yuepu Guo proposed a technical debt management framework
 based on three stages. First, debts are identified and listed. After
 that, debts are measured by their payment efforts and then debts are
 selected to be considered in the software development cycle. This study
 evaluates the application of this framework in the real context of
 software projects adopting Scrum. Action research is conducted in two
 companies where their projects have significant technical debt. We
 performed three action research cycles based on the three stages of the
 framework for both companies. The main contribution of this paper is to
 provide real experiences and improvements for projects using Scrum and
 that may adopt the technical debt management framework proposed by
 Seaman and Guo. Both teams recognized that the proposed approach is
 feasible for being considered in the software development process after
 some modifications. Because of projects time constraints and ease of
 use, we reduced the use of the proposed metrics to two: Principal and
 the Current Amount of Interest. In consequence, decision-making was
 benefitted by the early consideration of the debts that really need to
 be paid. Instead of using probabilities to find the interest, these are
 registered every time the technical debt occurs. During the first phase,
 the debts identification was improved when all Scrum roles participated,
 while measurement and decision-making were improved when the team was
 responsible for these phases. The Product Owner role in both companies
 understood the importance of Technical Debt monitoring and
 prioritization during a development cycle. With these changes, the two
 teams mentioned they would remain using the resulting approach.}},

 is being adopted by more and more organizations. However, there is a
 need for empirical evidence on the impact, benefits and drawbacks of an
 agile transformation in an organization since the cost for such a
 transformation in terms of money, disrupted working routines and quality
 of development can become considerable. Currently, such evidence exists
 in the form of success stores and case studies, mostly of qualitative
 nature.
 Objective: Provide a metrics model to quantitatively measure the impact
 of an agile transformation in a software development organization.
 Method: The metrics model was elicited with the use of the Goal Question
 Metric approach.
 Results: A quantitative metrics model containing eight rigorously
 described metrics is presented and followed by its application to
 evaluate an agile and lean transformation in a large international
 telecommunication organization with 350 employees in two sites.
 Conclusions: The metrics model was sensitive to the changes that
 occurred in the organization and revealed significant improvements in
 six of the eight metrics and a deterioration in one of the metrics. (C)

 a new approach of distributed shared pooling of IT infrastructure linked
 together to offer centralized IT services on demand. The study results
 determined that management's perception of security, cost-effectiveness

 adopt cloud computing. The results of multiple linear regression

  Abstract                 = {{The gap between how the academic world develops usability and user
 experience (UX) methods, and how the industry employs these methods is
 perceived as both broad and deep. But is that the real picture - and has
 there been a change in how companies work within these fields over the
 past two years? By conducting interviews with eight companies, this
 paper tries to answer these two questions. The companies were initially
 interviewed in 2013 and by follow-up interviews in 2015 the paper draws
 a picture of how the companies work with UX and usability in an agile
 development environment. We identify the challenges they are facing and
 if, and how the work progresses. We found that the UX maturity during
 these two years had changed significantly. This was revealed by the fact
 that almost all of the companies in 2015 had implemented or were in the
 process of developing a UX strategy together with more formalized UX
 processes. They also allocated more resources to conduct UX and
 usability work than earlier. We found that all of the companies made use
 of low-fi prototyping, followed by usability testing, workshops,
 personas, expert evaluations, user or customer journeys, customer visits
 and user task analyses. Almost all the companies carried out development
 using the Scrum framework. All of the companies were interested in the
 idea of agile UX, and found the idea of using the developers as a UX
 resource interesting. This, together with an idea of modifying existing
 usability methods to be used in an agile, industrial setting could be a
 solution to bridge the gap between academia and the industry.}},

 an important business. However, achieving what is adequate security
 requires taking bold steps to address security practices within the

 values. Agile teams have thus approached software security activities in
 their own way. To improve security within agile settings requires that
 management understands the current practices of software security
 activities within their agile teams.
 In this study, we use survey to investigate software security usage,
 competence, and training needs in two agile organizations.
 We find that (1) The two organizations perform differently in core
 software security activities but are similar when activities that could
 be leveraged for security are considered (2) regardless of cost or
 benefit, skill drives the kind of activities that are performed (3)
 Secure design is expressed as the most important training need by all
 groups in both organizations (4) Effective software security adoption in
 agile setting is not automatic, it requires a driver.}},

 Japanese software development projects to China, we were having
 difficulties with low quality deliverables and high turnover rate of
 Chinese members because of social differences. Our attempts to create a
 common culture were not very successful because people in general are
 less likely to change their basic views and behavior in a short period
 of time. We, however, were able to obtain success by acknowledging that
 differences are going to exist and adopting and adapting agile practices
 in consideration of the existence of these differences.
 We will show Kaizen as is used by a Japanese company in software
 development. We will focus on our experiences with social differences
 we've found and how we continuously adapted practices in our project to
 take better advantage of the situation as relationship between members
 changed. It is based on our over 10 years of experience in trying to
 improve a software package development at a software company in China,
 which has now become our subsidiary. During our attempts, we have
 learned the importance of agile mentality in resolving value difference
 issues. We believe what we've learned in adapting agile practices is not

 differences in organizations as well.}},

 concepts in practice by simulating several development Sprints, while
 incrementally planning and building a product of LEGO blocks. Student
 satisfaction was measured by a survey at the end of the course, and
 student learning evaluated by learning diaries. Our results show that
 the students were highly satisfied with the game, and that students with
 various degrees of experience with Scrum all learned a lot. In

 response to customer requirements. However, the project faced
 significant challenges in scaling Scrum despite attempts at applying the
 Large-scale Scrum (LeSS) framework. The organization experimented with
 different ways of implementing scaling practices like implementing
 common sprint planning meetings, Scrum-of-Scrums meetings, common demos

 an important part of a successful lean and agile adoption in particular

 Objective: In this paper, we present a study on how a large organization
 within Ericsson with 400 persons in 40 Scrum teams at three sites
 adopted the use of Communities of Practice (COP) as part of their
 transformation from a traditional plan-driven organization to lean and
 agile.
 Methods: We collected data by 52 semi-structured interviews on two
 sites, and longitudinal non-participant observation of the
 transformation during over 20 site visits over a period of two years.
 Results: The organization had over 20 CoPs, gathering weekly, hi-weekly
 or on a need basis. CoPs had several purposes including knowledge
 sharing and learning, coordination, technical work, and organizational
 development. Examples of CoPs include Feature Coordination CoPs to
 coordinate between teams working on the same feature, a Coaching CoP to
 discuss agile implementation challenges and successes and to help lead
 the organizational continuous improvement, an end-to-end CoP to remove
 bottlenecks from the flow, and Developers CoPs to share good development
 practices. Success factors of well-functioning CoPs include having a
 good topic, passionate leader, proper agenda, decision making authority,
 open community, supporting tools, suitable rhythm, and cross-site
 participation when needed. Organizational support include creating a
 supportive atmosphere and providing a suitable infrastructure for CoPs.
 Conclusions: In the case organization, CoPs were initially used to
 support the agile transformation, and as part of the distributed Scrum
 implementation. As the transformation progressed, the CoPs also took on
 the role of supporting continuous organizational improvements. CoPs
 became a central mechanism behind the success of the large-scale agile
 implementation in the case organization that helped mitigate some of the
 most pressing problems of the agile transformation. (c) 2014 The

 organization, how they work in practice, what they are used for, as well
 as the benefits and challenges of cultivating and implementing CoPs.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Competition in the automotive industry is intense, and successful
 companies must constantly innovate by introducing new technology to
 differentiate and improve their brands. As a result, today's vehicles
 have evolved from a mechanical device into an integrated machine with
 embedded software powering performance in all major systems including:
 engine control, power train, suspension, braking, and entertainment.
 Consider a few of these incredible statistics: today's vehicles have
 more computer processing power than NASA's early spacecraft. An
 ``average modern high end car{''} has more lines of code than an F-35
 Joint Strike Fighter. And finally, many automobiles actually have an
 addressable IP address. These technological improvements are driving
 brand success stories, as modern consumers' experiences are shaped more
 by the software than the hardware.
 A strong brand can create significant value in the automotive industry
 as a focus on integrated technology helps to drive brand loyalty and
 value. According to Interbrand's 15th annual Best Global Brands Report,
 the collective value of the automotive brands appearing on the Global
 Brands ranking increased 14.6 percent. Three out of the five `` Top
 Risers{''} listed were from the automotive sector, making the 15th
 annual report a record-breaking one for the auto industry.
 However, statistics also show that more than 50 percent of auto recalls
 are now due to software bugs, not mechanical issues. With an industry
 average of 5-10 bugs per thousand lines of code, the errors can pile up
 fast. As automobiles evolve from mechanical to software devices,
 automakers must rethink fundamental product development principles,
 including moving from a sequential, compartmentalized design process to
 a more agile approach, with higher degrees of collaboration between
 self-directed, cross-functional teams.
 This paper will outline why software quality needs to be at the top of
 the list for automotive OEMs looking to preserve - and elevate - their
 brand status. For quality to improve, continuous integration and
 continuous software testing are a necessity.
 While software testing has traditionally been viewed as a development
 expense, we will explain that when developed properly, software tests
 are an asset similar to source code that should provide value over the
 entire product life cycle.
 Well-designed tests allow regressions to be caught prior to product
 release, and lead to a reduction in branch damage and costs associated
 with product recalls.}},

 traceability maps in relation to requirements, architecture, functional
 models, components, and tests as a set of order type hierarchies and
 their cross-links. This paper lays out the structure of these ideal
 traceability relationships that define the essence of the product under
 development. The importance of the trace relationships to the product is
 clarified and then the abandonment of traceability in the Agile approach
 is discussed. Following that, a way to transform between synthetic
 canonical narrative (story) representations that appear in the product
 backlog and the traditionally separate hierarchical form of the trace
 structure of the product will be examined. The fact that it is possible
 to transform back and forth between the canonic narrative and
 traditional hierarchical representations of trace structures, and the
 fact that trace structures can be produced in a `just in time' fashion
 that evolves during product development demonstrate that these trace
 structures can be used in both an Agile and Lean fashion within the
 development process. Also, we can show that when the trace structure is
 produced outside the narrative representation it can have the additional
 benefit of helping to determine the precedent order of development so
 that rework can be avoided. The lack of the extrinsic external trace
 structure of the product that gives access to its intelligibility is, in
 fact, a form of technical debt. Thus, traditional trace structures using
 this model can be seen as an essential tool for product owners to
 produce sound and coherent development narratives and for structuring
 and prioritizing the backlog in the Agile and Lean approaches to
 software and systems development. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

 opinion, analogy, disaggregation etc. are adopted by researchers and
 practitioners. But no proper mathematical model exists for this. The
 existing techniques are ad-hoc and are thus prone to be incorrect. One
 popular approach of calculating effort of agile projects mathematically
 is the Story Point Approach (SPA). In this study, an effort has been

 the survey is to provide evidence-based assessment of the level of agile
 adoption by software development organizations, in relation to the
 general profile of the respondents (country of origin, business sectors,
 roles, etc.) and compared with different types of practices followed,
 such as agile techniques adopted, team organization and communication
 techniques, and project management. Particular patterns and trends are
 identified in the survey connecting the use of the agile paradigm with
 the aforementioned practices and investigating its relation with the

 emphasis with the increasing popularity of agile methods, which stress
 the central role of regression testing in maintaining software quality.
 The objectives of this article are to investigate regression testing
 strategies in agile development teams and identify the factors that can
 influence the adoption and implementation of this practice. We have used
 a mixed methods approach to our research, beginning with an analysis of
 the literature to identify research themes related to the adoption of
 regression testing techniques under agile methodologies, from which we
 developed an analytical framework for the study. This was followed by
 three exploratory case studies that we used to exercise the main
 elements of the framework, develop some key themes of interest, and
 devise a questionnaire for the final stage of the study, an on-line
 survey to explore the main issues identified in the case studies across
 different contexts. Within our specific sample, our results suggest that
 organizational maturity is a key factor in effective regression testing
 practices and that the adoption of such practices is helped by a
 coherent testing philosophy and change management processes. We also
 found that the return on investment in automated regression testing was
 positive for our respondents and that adopting these practices in the
 context of agile methods had been a relatively painless process for the
 organizations in our survey. We conclude that investing in regression
 testing tools and processes is likely to be beneficial for
 organizations. However, further work is needed in assessing how
 organizational culture impacts on the quality process and the financial
 outcomes for commercial software development organizations.}},

 diseases push the adoption of home care processes that can delay or

 software architectures provide means for effective integration and

 We describe the software architecture of an Electronic Health Record

 agile tailoring for the needs of different medical specialties. We then
 show how this adaptability can be further exploited to face a number of
 challenging requirements posed by the context of home care, including:
 patient-centric personalization of the record structure; user-adapted
 content presentation; automated support for compliance verification;
 systems medicine connection of clinical observations pertaining to

 stable and predictable way. This in a natural way implies the need for
 pre-deployment design-time verification of the decision making logic,
 meant by a process of proving that the logic deployed into the autonomic
 service/software component meets all requirements and will not lead to
 any unpredicted or unwanted behavior. There is actually no simple way
 that can be used for verification of the decision making logic used
 self-{*} and autonomic systems as only methods that use some kind of
 formalism can in an objective way verify the logic correctness. There is
 one problem, however, with this kind of approach - the formalism may
 vary depending on the way the decision making logic is expressed (for
 example, it may be in the form of a policy).
 In this paper, an approach to verification of policy decision making
 logic is based on its transformation into the corresponding Petri net
 using the proposed methodology. Consequently, the resulting Petri net
 can then be verified using Petri nets formalism and these verification
 results can be used to assess policy correctness. Two policies were used
 to illustrate the approach: ACSPolicy controlling the basic operation of
 an Air Conditioning System (ACS) in a car and ACSFullPolicy being its
 more sophisticated version allowing the controlled ACS to work in three
 pre-defined modes. The second policy shows how easily the proposed
 methodology scales up allowing the analysis policies of any complexity

  Abstract                 = {{Large pages have long been used to mitigate address translation
 overheads on big-memory systems, particularly in virtualized
 environments where TLB miss overheads are severe. We show, however, that
 far from being a panacea, large pages are used sparingly by modern
 virtualization software. This is because large pages often preclude
 lightweight memory management, which can outweigh their Translation
 Lookaside Buffer (TLB) benefits. For example, they reduce opportunities
 to deduplicate memory among virtual machines in overcommitted systems,
 interfere with lightweight memory monitoring, and hamper the agility of
 virtual machine (VM) migrations. While many of these problems are
 particularly severe in overcommitted systems with scarce memory
 resources, they can (and often do) exist generally in cloud deployments.
 In response, virtualization software often (though it doesn't have to)
 splinters guest operating system (OS) large pages into small system
 physical pages, sacrificing address translation performance for overall
 system-level benefits. We introduce simple hardware that bridges this
 fundamental conflict, using speculative techniques to group contiguous,
 aligned small page translations such that they approach the address
 translation performance of large pages. Our Generalized Large-page
 Utilization Enhancements (GLUE) allow system hypervisors to splinter
 large pages for agile memory management, while retaining almost all of
 the TLB performance of unsplintered large pages.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing has been widely adopted in
 recent years due to its inherent spectral efficiency and robustness to
 impulsive noise and fading. For cognitive radio applications in
 particular, it can enable flexible and agile spectrum allocation, yet
 suffers from spectral leakage in the form of large side lobes, leading
 to inter-channel interference unless mitigated carefully. Hence, recent
 OFDM-based standards such as IEEE 802.11p for vehicular communication
 and IEEE 802.11af for TV whitespace reuse impose strict spectrum
 emission mask limits to combat adjacent channel interference. Stricter
 masks allow channels to operate closer together, improving spectral
 efficiency at the cost of implementation difficulty. Meeting these
 strict limits is a significant challenge for implementing both 802.11p
 and 802.11af, yet remains an important requirement for enabling
 cost-effective systems. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds
 baseband filtering within a cognitive radio architecture to meet the
 specification for the most stringent 802.11p and 802.11af masks, while
 allowing up to ten additional active 802.11af sub-carriers to occupy a
 single basic channel without violating SEM specifications. The proposed
 method, performed at baseband, relaxes otherwise strict RF filter
 requirements, allowing the RF subsystem to be implemented using much
 less stringent 802.11a designs, resulting in cost reductions. (C) 2015

  Abstract                 = {{In recent years, an ever-increasing number of IT security incidents have
 been observed, often involving malicious software. In order to cope with
 the threat posed, it is essential to have a structured analysis workflow
 for assessment and mitigation.
 In this paper, we give a thorough explanation of the malware analysis
 workflow specified and employed by our team of analysts. It was deducted
 from observed work patterns and best practices with a strong focus on
 enabling collaboration, i.e. analyses conducted by multiple analysts in
 parallel in order to achieve a speed-up. The proposed workflow starts at
 the point where one or more malware samples have already been extracted.
 It consists of four phases as a whole, each with its own goals,
 constraints, and abort conditions.
 The first phase aims at gaining an overview of the current situation and
 specifying goals of the analysis and their respective priorities. The
 second phase features a preliminary analysis used to sharpen the picture
 of the threat, using methods of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and
 automated tools in order to obtain a quick assessment enabling first
 mitigation. In addition, one objective is to facilitate and prepare a
 more granular dissection of the malware sample, e. g. by unpacking and
 deobfuscation. The third phase comprises an in-depth analysis relying
 heavily on reverse engineering of selected parts of the malware. The
 selection may be influenced by earlier findings or focus on prominent
 aspects like nesting, functionality, or communication protocols. The
 final phase builds upon the results of the preceding phases, leading to
 tailored mitigation concepts for the specimen analysed.
 For each of the proposed phases, we give an overview of potential key
 tools, e. g. helping to gain information or improve collaboration. On a
 higher level, we highlight challenges to cooperative analysis and our
 approach to handle them. In this regard, the workflow contains adoptions
 of principles known from agile software development methodologies. For
 example, Scrum is used for management of tasks and coordination, aiding
 the creation of a reproducible and reliable chain of results.}},

 process who proposed approaches to improve the way how games are
 developed. These approaches usually adopt agile methodologies because of
 claims that traditional practices and the waterfall process are gone.
 However, are the ``old days{''} really gone in the game industry?
 In this paper, we present a survey of software engineering processes in
 video game industry from postmortem project analyses. We analyzed 20
 postmortems from Gamasutra Portal. We extracted their processes and
 modelled them through using the Business Process Model and Notation
 (BPMN).
 This work presents three main contributions. First, a postmortem
 analysis methodology to identify and extract project processes. Second,
 the study main result: the ``old days{''} are gone, but not completely.
 Iterative practices are increasing and are applied to at least 65\% of
 projects in which 45\% of this projects explicitly adopted Agile
 practices. However, waterfall process is still applied at least 30\% of
 projects. Finally, we discuss some implications, directions and
 opportunities for video game development community.}},

 teams and organizations that embrace agile and lean approaches. However,
 the flow of work faces many impediments as it flows through teams and

 impact teams and organizations. Often at the start of their agile
 transition, but also frequently after the initial transition, teams and
 organizations can find themselves with a significant quantity of
 impediments that demand attention. With limited time and capacity, they
 need techniques to help them understand the impediments and make
 decisions about where to invest their time. This paper introduces a new
 technique called Impediment Impact Diagrams that helps people to
 understand which impediments to address, and who needs to be involved in
 addressing them. The technique can also be used to understand other
 attributes of impediments such as the relative cost of removing the
 impediment, or the relative duration it is likely to take to remove the
 impediments. The Impediment Impact Diagram can be used on its own or as
 part of an Impediment Removal Process. Drawing from original research on
 impediment removal, this paper includes detailed steps to use the
 technique, presents several examples of Impediment Impact Diagrams from
 multiple teams and organizations, and describes their experiences with
 the technique.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The attitude of software learning by students relies on transforming the
 Learning Model consistently into Software Development Model. The effort
 and time taken for development of different phases of software, has few
 issues, in particular, the principles and practices to be followed in
 academia. To address these issues, a generic software teaching and
 learning model called eXtreme Software Teaching (XSOFT) is proposed by
 integrating the essence of the Extreme Programming (XP) method with
 COSMIC FFP (Common Software Measurement Integration Consortium Full
 Function Point) Standards. The effectiveness of this proposed model was
 tested on real time projects assigned to students as a realistic study
 by selecting them with equal skill and knowledge on programming. They
 were divided into two groups, such as Pair Programmers and Solo
 Programmers. The performances of these groups are measured with respect
 to the trade in person-days using XSOFT. The empirical results show that
 the assessment of person-days are less on pair programming than solo
 programming and effective programming skill is found with pair
 programmers. In addition, the robustness of this model are confirmed by
 the results of another real time project as case study. (c) 2014 Wiley

 architecture, where application is composed of a set of independently
 deployable services, is increasingly becoming popular due to its
 capability to address most of these needs and challenges. In recent
 years, the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) has become one of the most
 popular agile software development processes, and frequently used in
 microservices development. The key to success of BDD is the executable
 acceptance tests that describe the expected behavior of a feature and
 its acceptance criteria in the form of scenarios using simple and
 business people readable syntax. The reusability, auditability, and
 maintainability become some of the major concerns when BDD test
 framework is applied for each microservice repository and no previous
 research addresses these concerns. In this paper, we present a reusable
 automated acceptance testing architecture to address all these concerns.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The use of software tools has become a common practice in global
 software engineering to handle requirements and to exchange project
 status amongst distributed teams and stakeholders. In context of agile
 software development the replacement of paper-based media (e. g. Task
 Board) with software tools results in heavily decreased collaboration
 and transparency within agile teams. Since the number of agile projects
 in global context increases, it is necessary to find an adequate
 solution to share project status without influencing the underlying
 agile process in a negative way. The proposed research project
 investigates why the replacement of paper-based media has such strong
 influence on group work in agile teams. Thereby, the focus of research
 is on the agile Task Board as the most important example for paper-based
 media of agile workspaces. With help of these findings we will develop a
 conceptual and technical solution, based on optical tracking of a
 paper-based Task Board, to share project status amongst stakeholders.

  Abstract                 = {{Global software development (GSD) is gaining momentum due to the
 potential benefits it offers. GSD aims at delivering remarkable software
 through a widely distributed pool of experts, with reduced efforts,
 minimum cost and time. In recent years, GSD developers have reshaped the

 engineering principles to cope with the frequent changes in
 requirements, accelerate the development in short increments and to
 produce energy efficient and sustainable software. However, the adoption
 of agile methods for developing sustainable software possesses a number
 of challenges. This paper presents a list of potential challenges/risks
 identified through systematic literature review (SLR) that need to be
 avoided by the GSD vendors using agile methods for the development of
 green and sustainable software. Our findings reveal eight risk factors
 that are faced by GSD vendors in the development of green and
 sustainable software using agile methods. GSD vendors are encouraged to
 address properly all the identified factors in general and the
 most-frequently cited critical risks in particular, such as in-
 sufficient system documentation, limited support for real-time systems
 and large systems, management overhead, lack of customer's presence,
 lack of formal communication and lack of long term planning.}},

 Developmentmethodology, it is essential to continuously integrate the

 frequently so it needs to streamlineprocesses to orchestrate the tests.
 So it is difficult to manage the software development life cycle for
 those changes and maintain the software code quality. To maintain the
 product quality it is essential to integrate the product component and
 need to deploy a product on pre-production environment and test the
 product. Hence the need for Continuous Integration and Continuous
 Delivery process for software product. The popularization ofDevOps, and
 cloud computing has revolutionized the software delivery process-making
 it faster and affordable for business to release their software
 continuously. Hence Enterprises need for reliable and predictable

 effective framework for automated testing and deployment to help to
 automate the code analysis, test selection, test scheduling, environment
 provisioning, test execution, results analysis and deployment pipeline.

 model uses iterative steps that can create changes in each phase of
 software development process. This will challenge security to ensure the
 application has few flaws or vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
 Failure to impose the right security measures at each of these phases
 can open up vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit and prove costly in
 patching. This paper will explore areas where security can be engaged
 within each iteration step of the spiral development model. This way
 security can continue protection of the software product as it becomes
 ready for deployment. The paper will help organizations realize where to
 deploy security measures to reduce vulnerabilities in the software

  Abstract                 = {{Nowadays, many individuals and teams involved on projects are already
 using agile development techniques as part of their daily work. However,
 we have much less experience in how to scale and manage agile practices
 in distributed software development. Distributed and global
 development-that requiring attention to many technical, organizational,
 and cultural issues as the teams interact to cooperatively delivery the
 solution. Alongside, very large team sizes, teams of teams, and more
 complex management structures forcing additional attention to
 coordination and management. At this level, there is an increasing need
 to standardize best practices to avoid reinvention and miscommunication
 across artifacts and processes. Complexity issues in enterprise software
 delivery can have significant impact on the adoption of agile
 approaches. As a consequence, agile strategies will typically need to be
 evaluated, tailored, and perhaps combined with traditional approaches to
 suit the particular context. The characteristics of software products
 and software development processes open up new possibilities that are
 different from those offered in other domains to achieve leanness and
 flexibility. Whilst Lean principles are universal, a further
 understanding of the techniques required to apply such principles from a
 software development angle. Thus, the aim of this research is to
 identify, how can combination of Lean and Agile practices facilitate to
 scale and manage distributed software development.}},

 specifications can be solidified. This is due to the unbending structure
 of old and traditional methodologies. Over the last decade, more than a
 few innovative software development methodologies have been developed
 particularly to resolve problems in the region of software quality. Such
 group of methodologies is called ``agile.{''} These methodologies mostly
 focus on how to maximize flexibility and minimize transparency in the
 process of software development. These methodologies are not only based
 on theory, but also rather derived from experiences of successful
 project teams. Based on the current trend in the software industry,
 software developing companies are choosing agile methodologies in which
 scrum is widely used. In this work, the adoption process of scrum by a

 approaches among the existing Agile methodologies has been successfully

 only the learning of programming practices within a Scrum team.
 Furthermore, few studies tackle nontechnical skills other than the
 development practices themselves. The work presented here introduces an
 original Scrum-based training model enhanced with agile coaching to
 maximize student performance. This was validated by a case study on a
 capstone project in a Scrum course. This paper summarizes the positive
 results of introducing agile coaching, which resulted in approximately
 22\% more coverage of software engineering practices. In addition, a
 survey data showed that, compared to students who did not receive
 coaching, coached students gained valuable insight into the
 internalization of Scrum, problem solving, and guidance by means of
 checkpoint meetings.}},

 we have developed Virtual Scrum, an educational virtual world that

 support. Students' feedback showed that Virtual Scrum is a viable and
 effective tool to implement the different elements in a Scrum team room

 RESULTS: The systematic mapping study includes 50 primary studies
 published between 2001 and 2014. An in-depth analysis of the primary
 studies revealed ten recurrent themes that characterize continuous
 deployment and provide researchers with directions for future work. In
 addition, a set of benefits and challenges of which practitioners may
 take advantage were identified. CONCLUSION: Overall, although the topic

 last years. However, it remains unclear how Lean is implemented in a
 domain that fundamentally differs from the automotive industry in which
 it originated. This study provides empirical evidence of how Lean can be
 combined with Agile methods to enhance software development processes. A
 case study was conducted at Elektrobit Wireless Segment, which has used
 Agile from 2007 and began to adopt Lean in 2010. Our findings evidence
 numerous compatibilities between Lean and Agile. In addition to
 well-established practices in Agile, Lean thinking has brought new
 elements to software development such as Kanban and work-in-progress
 limits, a ``pull{''} and ``less waste{''} oriented culture, and a
 stronger emphasis on transparency and collaborative development. Scaling
 flexibility, business management involvement and waste reduction were
 found as challenges, whilst setting up teams, self-organization and
 empowerment appeared easier to achieve.}},

 provide us with a wealth of data relating to consumption-based
 environmental impacts at a national level. The results can identify the
 categories of consumption and sectors of production that contribute most
 to environmental impact allowing policy makers to prioritise
 intervention into particular areas. However, these data are not readily
 accessible to policy makers and civil society, making it difficult to
 extract and communicate the important messages it contains.
 The web-based tool-EUREAPA-was created as a usable, task-oriented
 interface to improve access to environmental and economic data held
 within a complex EE-MRIO model and make it more relevant to policy
 makers and civil society. The project team of scientists and IT
 specialists used an iterative, agile and participatory approach to
 engage potential end-users in the specification and testing of the tool.
 The engagement process identified two principal functions that were
 essential for the EUREAPA tool: viewing data and creating scenarios. The
 viewing data function allows users to analyse the wealth of data held
 within the model and present results from a range of perspectives. This
 helps to understand the causes of environmental pressure and identify
 priorities for policy intervention. The scenario function helps to
 communicate how changes in consumption and production might affect the
 future environmental impact of citizens of the EU, and facilitates
 long-term planning.
 Through this dialogue process the project has been able to ensure
 EUREAPA is relevant, user-friendly and fit-forpurpose. It is intended
 that EUREAPA will be adopted by policy makers and civil society as an
 important policy planning and assessment aid in the complex field of
 sustainable consumption and production. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

 integral part of a software program's overall quality assurance

 web applications-is frequently automated, perhaps being the centerpiece
 of automated testing efforts. However, the build-out of an automated
 testing suite is expensive, requiring specialized software, frameworks,
 and staff who typically possess programming knowledge. Indeed, it is
 common to have roles such as that of a Test Automation Engineer or
 Software Developer In Test (SDET) on Agile teams these days,
 supplementing traditional Quality Analysts. With regard to web
 application tests, however, the calculus on whether or not to automate
 these tests is changing. Enter on-demand services-they have become
 available to perform manual testing as needed, without introducing
 delay, and are often many times faster than equivalent automated tests.
 These on-demand services feature test scripts written in natural
 language, which are executed by trained external testers when prompted,
 such that feedback is rapidly provided on the results of the testing. In
 this article, we'll explore these on-demand services (which can also be
 referred to as ``Testing as a Service{''}) and provide business and
 financial analysis illustrating when this approach may complement or be
 a better alternative to building an automated testing suite for

 software that makes the process possible. By the proper utilization of
 hypervisors agility, flexibility and efficiency may be gained in
 engineering hands-on education. Layered accreditation and certification
 impose additional challenges on engineering and cyber security programs.
 Consequently, there is an extra degree of oversight, assessment and
 thoroughness required in curricula in order to meet all standards. At
 National University only through the use of virtualization is it
 possible to add hands-on experience in a one-month delivery of a full
 semester of instruction per course. The use of virtualization through
 private and public cloud delivery as well as on a student's personal
 computer makes this possible. The employment of multi-factor
 authentication and a VPN provides the necessary security for students
 who are dispersed all over the world. The collaborative synergy of
 Computer Science, Information Technology and Cyber Security disciplines
 has made the creation of a dynamically morphing virtual lab possible.
 The teaching efficiencies gained by using virtualization are
 significant: 1) the lab exercises do not impact the student's base
 laptop configuration, 2) the immediate exercise is made available for
 completion, 3) the synergy of having assignments and labs intermixed
 throughout the teaching cycle reinforce one another, and 4) the
 versatility and ability of the instructor to introduce new concepts
 literally dynamically helps maintain current courseware.}},

 the success factors for effective change management. Although these
 factors are essential in establishing beneficial norms and practices,
 the existing research does not adequately address the importance of

 represent practices that are well established. Accurate process labeling
 is the foundation for creating any inter-organizational lessons. This
 paper establishes the link between linguistic manipulation and how it
 might lead to a form of symbolic innovation that can impede a greater
 understanding of transformational challenges. During an agile
 transformation some organizational actors re-label deterministic
 plan-driven processes using agile language. The symbolic innovation
 leads to no improvement and as a result is more easily abandoned without
 meaningful process change.}},

 production as soon as it is ready, which is receiving increased adoption
 in industry. The frequency of updates of mobile software has
 traditionally lagged the state of practice for cloud-based service for a
 number of reasons. Mobile versions can only be released periodically.
 Users can choose when and if to upgrade, which means that several
 different releases coexist in production. There are hundreds of Android
 hardware variants, which increases the risk of having errors in the
 software being deployed.
 Facebook has made significant progress in increasing the frequency of
 its mobile deployments. Over a period of 4 years, the Android release
 has gone from a deployment every 8 weeks to a deployment every week. In
 this paper, we descibe in detail the mobile deployment process at FB. We
 present our findings from an extensive analysis of software engineering
 metrics based on data collected over a period of 7 years. A key finding
 is that the frequency of deployment does not directly affect developer
 productivity of software quality. We argue that this finding is due to
 the fact that increasing the frequency of continuous deployment forces
 improved release and deployment automation, which in turn reduces
 developer workload. Additionally, the data we present shows that
 dog-fooding and obtaining feedback from alpha and beta customers is
 critical to mainataining release quality.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In the last few years we have witnessed the expansion of REST APIs as a
 method to implement machine-to-machine interactions in open distributed
 systems. Recently REST APIs can also be found in several B2B and
 enterprise scenarios that were previously reserved to alternative
 technologies such as SOAP-based Web Services. Despite that, the
 development of REST-based solutions has remained mostly inspired by
 agile approaches with no or limited explicit modeling artifacts produced
 during the development process. This clashes with software development
 methods in which modeling artifacts are expected to be available for all
 developed software. Another problem is related to the resource-based
 nature of these APIs that miss standardized methods to discover and
 understand their capabilities akin to what object-oriented interfaces
 can do for objects and services. In this paper we propose a model-driven
 approach to REST API development; this approach is composed by two main
 steps: (i) UML modeling of the API using specific profiles and (ii) a
 model transformation that exploits RAML, a recent RESTful API modeling
 language, as an intermediate notation that can be used to automatically
 produce documentation and code for various languages/platforms.}},

 OSS does not harm security; on the contrary, it enhances it. Even with
 some drawbacks, OSS is highly reliable and maintained by a huge software
 community, thus decreasing implementation costs and increasing
 reliability. Moreover, it allows military software engineers to move
 away from proprietary applications and single-vendor contracts.
 Furthermore, it decreases the cost of long-term development and
 lifecycle management, besides avoiding vendor's lock in. Nevertheless,
 deploying OSS deserves an appropriate organization of its life cycle and
 maintenance, which has a relevant impact on the project's budget that
 cannot be overseen. In this paper, we will describe some of the major
 trends in OSS in Defense environments. The community for OSS has a
 pivotal role, since it is the core development unit. With Agile and the
 newest DevOps methodologies, government officials could leverage OSS
 capabilities, decreasing the Design (or Technical) Debt. Software for
 Defense purposes could perform better, increase the number of the
 releases, enhance coordination through the different IT Departments (and
 the community), and increase release automation, decreasing the
 probability of errors.}},

 investigated are: (a) characteristics of pair programming that are less

 product quality, and (c) whether it is better to train a pair by giving
 routine tasks first or by giving complex tasks first. Our results show
 that: (a) the least liked aspects of pair programming were having to
 share the screen, keyboard and mouse, and having to switch between the
 roles of driver and navigator (b) programmers solved complex problems
 more effectively in pairs compared to routine problems, however,
 perceptions of team effectiveness was higher when solving routine
 problems than when solving complex problems and (c) programmers who
 started pair programming with routine tasks and moved on to complex
 tasks were more effective than those who started with complex ones and
 moved on to routine ones. We discuss how these results will assist the
 industry in inducting programmers without prior pair-programming
 experience into XP process environments.}},

 environment where both industry and university collaborate, is
 challenging due to many factors. In fact, industrial companies and
 universities have generally different interests and objectives whenever
 they collaborate. For this reason, it is not easy to manage and
 negotiate the industrial companies' interests, namely schedules and
 their expectations. Conducting such projects in an agile framework is
 expected to decrease these risks, since partners have the opportunity to
 frequently interact with the development team in short iterations and
 are constantly aware of the characteristics of the system under
 development. However, in this type of collaborative R\&D projects, it is
 often advantageous to include some waterfall practices, like upfront
 requirements modeling using UML models, which are not commonly used in
 agile processes like Scrum, in order to better prepare the
 implementation phase of the project. This paper presents some lessons
 learned that result from experience of the authors in adopting some
 Scrum practices in a R\&D project, like short iterations, backlogs, and
 product increments, and simultaneously using UML models, namely use

 They are successful in projects characterized by rapid changes, small
 teams and small cycles. Implementing the same agile philosophy but with
 an increase of complexity, i.e., large-scale agile (LSA) development,
 are sometimes criticized of not being as effective as typical ASD,
 requiring additional concerns and the need to address new research
 challenges. This PhD research proposes an approach for embedding
 architecture design in agile development, first in early analysis and
 then during the iterations and by properly providing the mechanisms to
 deal with the changes in requirements. The main result is a method for
 adopting logical architectures, Four-Step-Rule-Set (4SRS), properly
 adapted to ASD contexts, to be used as complementary approaches to an
 ASD lifecycle, so that ASD teams can use that information as input for

  Abstract                 = {{Agile software development is known by focusing on interaction among
 team members to share knowledge. However, little guidance is provided to
 encourage interaction across agile teams. Based on a preliminary
 conceptual model, this paper examines influencing factors, such as
 organizational strategy, and communication flow and channels, regarding
 inter-team knowledge sharing (KS) effectiveness in agile environments.
 We analyze the characteristics and the influence of the mentioned
 factors through a survey research method. Data was gathered from seven
 Brazilian agile software organizations. We employed statistical analysis
 techniques, e. g., structural equation modeling and cross-table
 analysis, to analyze the results. Within the surveyed companies,
 organizational strategy reflects on moderate commitment towards
 knowledge. KS practices are carried out to an acceptable standard.
 Extensive communication flow and the use of several channels denote that
 agile companies are also fostering interaction across teams. We found
 strong relationship between these factors and the companies' experience
 on agile methods. As companies continue on an agile adoption program,
 they growingly focus on long-term goals and consider knowledge as
 strategic resource. However, they still need to improve strategy
 alignment to all organization levels. Thus, we recommend that agile
 companies consider these factors when striving on this endeavor.}},

 huge variety of cloud applications to the end-users, which are
 increasingly pushing the limits of the currently deployed computing and

 especially when they are combined with an intelligent software defined

 of an optical flexible hardware framework operated by an agile software
 and virtualization platform. The LIGHTNESS deeply programmable
 all-optical circuit and packet switched data plane is able to perform
 unicast/multicast switch-over on-demand, while the powerful software
 defined networking (SDN) control plane enables the virtualization of
 computing and network resources creating a virtual data center and
 virtual network functions (VNF) on top of the data plane. We
 experimentally demonstrate realistic intra DCN with deterministic
 latencies for both unicast and multicast, showcasing monitoring, and
 database migration scenarios each of which is enabled by an associated
 network function virtualization element. Results demonstrate a fully
 functional complete unification of an advanced optical data plane with
 an SDN control plane, promising more efficient management of the
 next-generation data center compute and network resources.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In agile Model-Driven Engineering, the evolution of diverse software
 artifacts is omnipresent. Especially the evolution of metamodels,
 defining the grammar of, e.g., Domain Specific Languages, is quite
 challenging, since many dependent artifacts, including models and
 transformations, have to be co-evolved to re-establish consistency.
 Although much research effort has been spent to automate co-evolution,
 crucial issues remain open and a systematic survey of the state of
 research across different domains is still missing. This paper provides
 an extensive survey evaluating various co-evolution approaches also from
 areas in software engineering like data, ontology, and grammar
 engineering on basis of a detailed set of criteria serving as a research
 roadmap for further developments in the area of co-evolution for agile
 MDE. Based on these results, a conceptual co-evolution framework is
 presented and illustrated by a running example especially targeting a
 decrease in co-evolution effort, an increase in coevolution consistency,
 and an advance in extensibility.}},

 create a hybrid control scheme that is able to use information about the

 posited in earlier work by the authors that information theory is key in
 understanding which among a given set of controllers will perform the

  Abstract                 = {{This paper introduces the Agile Mission Development Facility (AMDF), a
 concept for a new mission development platform at NASAWallops that will
 develop a specific kind of Earth observing missions based on networks of
 small assets (CubeSats, UAVs and balloons) in a timeframe of weeks to
 months.
 To achieve this reduced development time, the AMDF will use a new
 catalog-based and platform-based approach to mission design that
 emphasizes commonality at the subsystem or assembly level and the use of
 COTS components when possible. This will necessarily constrain the range
 of performance achievable by these missions, since only a few
 alternatives will be available for each subsystem. Only missions whose
 objectives can be achieved through a combination of the available
 modules will be considered.
 In addition to providing a high-level description of the AMDF
 architecture, this paper describes the process by which this platform
 consisting of a few standard modules will be optimally designed to
 maximize the range of attainable performance while keeping short
 development times. Particular emphasis is put on the communications
 module that will enable cross-links between nanosatellites, UAVs,
 balloons, and ground assets.
 Importantly, the AMDF focuses on a different customer segment than other
 similar NASA facilities such as the IDC at GSFC or Team X at JPL. AMDF
 Missions are not meant to compete with larger NASA missions in terms of
 performance, operational risk or mission assurance, but rather they
 intend to be complementary. In particular, the very short development
 time and multi-asset character of these systems will enable a completely
 new class of missions that can effectively respond to a rapidly changing
 phenomenon of opportunity, such as a hurricane, a volcano or a
 geopolitical event of interest for which a larger mission would be
 inappropriate. Additionally, they can be used to accelerate technology
 infusion for future larger missions, as long as the new technology
 satisfies a certain set of interface requirements.
 The AMDF will maximize reuse of existing design, integration and testing
 software and hardware infrastructure at NASA Wallops as well as other
 NASA centers. All potentially relevant stakeholders, such as NASA
 Goddard, Headquarters, JPL, Ames, the Aerospace Corp., Applied Physics
 Lab, and universities with nanosatellite programs will be involved and
 considered in the AMDF development process.
 This paper focuses on the description of the design aspects of the AMDF,
 as this is where most of the novelty lies. Integration, testing,
 launching and operations are only briefly discussed. A description of
 the system architecture of the AMDF is given using model-based systems
 engineering tools (SysML). An example application mission to measure
 ecological changes in the Jefferson and Washington National Forests is
 also discussed to illustrate the new kinds of missions that this
 facility could enable.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Research suggests that different teaching styles and multiple exposures
 of different styles to material can aid in the learning process. While
 there are guidelines for identifying the best teaching style for
 material, new and evolving areas can present unique challenges. The
 emerging area of mobile software development, which combines aspects of
 software, hardware, and interpersonal interaction, captures many such
 challenges; e.g., understanding how to develop for multiple screen
 sizes, designing for GPS time lag, dealing with unreliable sensor data.
 Teaching these challenging materials seemed well suited for multiple
 approaches that leveraged different learning styles. This paper examines
 three teaching approaches employed in ten teaching modules across two
 semesters of a mobile software development course. The approaches
 included lectures, interactive tutorials, and Pair Programming. Lectures
 were used to introduce topics and explore underlying theories of
 development. The lectures included time for questions from and for the
 students, but otherwise did not have an active learning component. Two
 active learning approaches used in the class were interactive tutorials
 and Pair Programming. Interactive tutorials presented applied
 development approaches, then explored their use in an individual based
 hands-on demos. Pair Programming is an agile software development
 practice, used in both industry and education, which enforces a
 role-based approach to learning new programming concepts. Homeworks were
 used to assess learning, and surveys reflected student satisfaction.
 Results show areas of promise and of concern with regard to the learning
 styles. It seems that repetition of topics is important for mastery of
 the topics. Foundational theories seem well suited for lectures, while
 programming concepts work better in active learning situations.
 Additional learning took place through office hours, online question
 forums, and individual and group online exploration. The findings
 suggest specific approaches to teaching challenging and unique mobile
 software development topics as well as a general approach to identifying
 ways to distribute learning objectives across lectures, interactive
 tutorials, and Pair Programming sessions.}},

 classes are facing almost the same problems of small teams in industry.
 To tackle these problems, various approaches for integrating agile
 development methods and UX design methods have been proposed to help
 developers carefully consider the UX requirements, and to be able to
 organize their work environment. In this paper, we explore how such
 integration can be a good fit for both CS students and software
 developers, especially for those who work on mobile development. We
 present our proposed set of integration guidelines, and then we focus on
 Pair Programming (PP) as an agile practice that promotes a collaborative
 work environment. The expert reviews conducted in this paper helped us
 exlore how PP can be introduced to CS students (and later, to developers
 in the market) to support collaborative work environments. Moreover,
 Using PP in class provides an adaptive and collaborative teaching
 approach that can be used in CS programming labs. We also discuss the
 pitfalls that can affect developers during PP sessions, and how to avoid
 such negative effects. We conclude by providing a set of recommended
 practices that can be applied to introduce P1' for developers in both

 network infrastructure consisting of computing hardware, operating

 Traditional networks are difficult to automate because of the
 distributed nature of their decision making process for switching or
 routing which are collocated on the same device. Managing complex
 environments using traditional networks is time-consuming and expensive,
 especially in the case of generating virtual machines, migration and
 network configuration. To mitigate the challenges, network operations
 require efficient, flexible, agile and scalable software defined

 and such an environment seems unsuited for Agile to succeed. In such
 scenarios, it is a challenge to be able to bring together the
 organizations Agile methodology, development environment, and
 distributed teams together in a standardized way, to be able to
 implement and govern the distributed delivery process objectively. Here,
 we present our approach to govern the adoption, usage and progress
 thereof of a distributed Agile methodology, that ties together the team
 and tool aspects with it. This becomes a single window to quickly
 bootstrap distributed Agile delivery projects using specific methods,
 metrics and dashboards, collaboration and gamification approaches. We
 have implemented this approach as an interactive Agile Workbench to
 present the teams and stakeholders with context-rich actionable alerts
 as well as situational awareness and helps bridge the gaps between
 cross-functional distributed teams which is essential to successful
 delivery of agile projects.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The Agile way of developing and delivering software systems is gaining
 mainstream adoption due to the imperatives of a quickly changing
 technical landscape, business requirements and customer expectations. To
 truly leverage the power of Agile, big organizations need to be able to
 utilize distributed teams effectively. However, Agile delivery relies
 hugely on collaboration among team members and this can become a
 stumbling block among such geographically dispersed teams. Moreover, in
 such large projects the development and process layer needs to be
 monitored for any problematic patterns or events that could potentially
 cause the Sprints to fail. Here, we describe an automated approach which
 allows for contextual collaboration in such distributed Agile projects.
 The approach captures important events from the process and the
 development environment and uses a rule based approach to then
 automatically create awareness regarding them to appropriate roles in
 the project. Every team member receives an actionable feed in a
 MyContext pane which then leads the team member to navigate to an
 Activity centric context where collaboration specific to that activity
 can take place. This approach has been implemented in a process guidance
 and awareness workbench that we are piloting within our organization.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Medical software development poses an interesting challenge from the
 process and Quality Management System (QMS) perspective. Being software,
 on one hand there are several process models/finmeworks available in the
 industry practice, all claiming to be the ultimate pinnacle and this
 list gets supplemented as more research happens in the area of software
 engineering. On the other hand, healthcare is a regulated industry
 governed by region specific regulations. These regulations are not
 standardized across the globe which makes it quite challenging for a
 medical device manufacturer to abide by the corresponding country
 specific regulations where the product is going to be launched. For e.g.
 US is regulated by Quality Systems requirements of FDA and 510(k)
 approval process, Europe is governed by CE marking and ISO 13485
 standard, China has its SFDA requirements whereas Japan follows PAL
 regulations. With the software content in the medical device increasing
 and number of recalls/ field issues in medical products being traced to
 software, the regulators are becoming increasingly stricter when it
 comes to processes that govern design and development of medical
 software.
 Although there are many similarities in all these standards/models as
 the genesis of all of them is the PDCA (Plan Do-Check-Act) approach,
 there are subtle important differences as well because each is optimized
 for a certain purpose. If regulatory standards are more focused on
 product safety and risk management, the CMMI (R) is more oriented
 towards continuous improvements. There is also lot of utility in the
 techniques proposed by the Agile and the Six-Sigma methodologies but
 then by itself these cannot become the complete Quality System. The
 situation is further aggravated by the fact that every stakeholder has
 different expectation from the software project teams for e.g. a project
 manager may want to follow iterative strategy to manage project risks
 better but the regulators on the other hand may expect
 documentation/evidences in a water-fall like manner, the top management
 may expect the team to adhere to all possible standards/models whereas
 the project team would want to follow as minimum requirements as
 possible and so on.
 This paper has tried to depict the challenges and dilemmas faced by
 medical software development teams because of availability of various
 models/standards/frameworks and the corresponding pros and cons of each.
 To navigate through this maze, it starts first by looking at the process
 landscape with the purpose of these various models/standards, and then
 tries to analyze the comparisons that have been done amongst the various
 models/standards in a number of published technical papers. Based on the
 experience of using some of these, the paper presents the insight in the
 form of propositions and recommends QMS architecture both structural and
 operational that can be used by any medical software teams. The QMS
 based on the proposed structure has led to effort savings, stood the
 test of time in satisfying majority of the stakeholder needs and
 simultaneously not compromised on the regulatory aspects. The positive
 trends on the various performance indicators stand a testimony to the
 successful implementation of an optimal process framework for regulated
 medical software.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Software organisations have been experiencing software project failures
 since the beginning of software development. These failures include
 among others, abandoned and runaway projects, cost overruns, and low
 quality software. The Standish Group CHAOS report and the ITWeb report
 indicate that less than 50\% of all projects are successful. Lack of
 skills and failure to learn are some reasons why projects fail. Many
 intervention strategies have been tried by software organisations to
 address this issue. Such strategies include software process improvement
 (SPI) models and new software development methodologies such as agile
 methods. These intervention strategies don't seem to be working because
 software development projects continue to fail. To address this issue,
 software organisations are turning to knowledge management (KM). This is
 because software development is a knowledge intensive task. KM is a
 series of processes that seek to acquire, create, capture and store,
 transfer and apply knowledge to organisational routines and processes.
 KM is believed to increase efficiency thus improving the software
 development process. This study investigated KM practices in 10 software
 organisations in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South African.
 Interviews were conducted with 10 software project managers to determine
 if software organisations in South Africa have adopted KM and whether KM
 has improved performance. The results reveal seven KM activities;
 knowledge acquisition, creation, storage, organisation, transfer,
 application and learning. Learning indicates improved performance. The
 study concluded that South African software organisations practice KM
 and that KM has helped them perform their duties better. The study
 recommends that software organisations collect and store knowledge in
 central repositories so that it becomes easy to manage and access,
 implement knowledge organisation and retrieval strategies for easy
 knowledge identification, retrieval and dissemination.}},

 by the software companies for cost and time benefits. However, it causes
 significant challenges considering the contradicting nature of the agile
 and distributed development.
 Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a risk management
 framework that comprises the perceived risks in DAD projects, their
 causes and the methods used in industry for managing those risks.
 Method: This work is an extension of an exploratory study, wherein, DAD
 practitioners reported the risks they face in projects and the methods
 they use for managing those risks. The identified risks were further
 categorized based on their relevance to different aspects of DAD
 projects. In this extension, industry practitioners ranked the risks for
 their impact on DAD projects and rated the methods for the frequency of
 their use in projects. As the number of risks under each category was
 large for ranking, they were grouped under the risk areas within each
 category. The ranking of risk categories, risk areas and risk factors
 for their impact on DAD projects manifests their importance. The
 framework includes ranked risks, their causes and the risk management
 approaches. It was partially implemented in live projects in three
 different companies and was found to be beneficial.
 Results: The perceived impact of the risk categories, `Group Awareness',
 `External Stakeholder Collaboration' and `Software Development Life
 Cycle' on DAD projects has been found to be high and caused by the
 properties of Distributed Software Development (DSD). The partial
 validation of the framework in three companies reported the elimination
 of majority of risk factors and/or reduction in their impact.
 Conclusion: DAD projects provide significant benefits but hold
 substantial risks due to the contradiction between distributed
 development and agile practices. The reported framework could
 effectively minimize the DAD risks in practice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

 Relatively scanty evidence of research on the risks prevailing in
 distributed agile development (DAD) has motivated this study.
 Objective: This paper aims at creating a comprehensive set of risk
 factors that affect the performance of distributed agile development
 projects and identifies the risk management methods which are frequently
 used in practice for controlling those risks.
 Method: The study is an exploration of practitioners' experience using
 constant comparison method for analyzing in-depth interviews of thirteen
 practitioners and work documents of twenty-eight projects from thirteen
 different information technology (IT) organizations. The field
 experience was supported by extensive research literature on risk
 management in traditional, agile and distributed development.
 Results: Analysis of qualitative data from interviews and project work
 documents resulted into categorization of forty-five DAD risk factors
 grouped under five core risk categories. The risk categories were mapped
 to Leavitt's model of organizational change for facilitating the
 implementation of results in real world. The risk factors could be
 attributed to the conflicting properties of DSD and agile development.
 Besides that, some new risk factors have been experienced by
 practitioners and need further exploration as their understanding will
 help the practitioners to act on time.
 Conclusion: Organizations are adopting DAD for developing solutions that
 caters to the changing business needs, while utilizing the global
 talent. Conflicting properties of DSD and agile approach pose several
 risks for DAD. This study gives a comprehensive categorization of the
 risks faced by the practitioners in managing DAD projects and presents
 frequently used methods to reduce their impact. The work fills the

 Objective: In this paper we sought to identify and synthesize papers
 that describe and analyze DPP both from teaching and practice
 perspectives. Method: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review to
 search for empirical evidence in eight digital libraries.
 Results: Most of the 34 DPP primary studies identified explore DPP from
 a teaching perspective. We found that DPP requires a specific
 infrastructure, but the existing studies do not explore the impact of
 the distribution in the details. There are many tools proposed that
 support DPP practice, but few of them are evaluated within a software
 development team.
 Conclusion: We need more studies that explore the effects of Pair
 Programming in the context of Distributed Software Development, such as
 coordination and communication. Most of the studies do not empirically
 evaluate DPP in industry. There is also a need to propose guidelines to
 use DPP in industry and as a teaching strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {{Scientific publications throughout the years describe study cases and
 experience reports from organizations that have been through the agile
 adoption process. At the same time, frameworks and generic methods for
 adoption have also been published intending to obtain some
 predictability on the steps of this transition. However, when disposing
 of either generic or specific inputs to help them on their way towards
 agility, companies do not know how or where to start their changes. This
 short paper describes the current investigation state of a systematic
 review that aims to understand better how organizations effectively
 adopt agile methods, trying to find a correlation between the
 characteristics of an organization and the way it effectively
 transitions to agile.}},

 domains, especially in large-scale software development. Given the
 benefits experienced and reported, SPL engineering has increasingly
 garnered interest from small to medium-sized companies. It is possible
 to find a wide range of studies reporting on the challenges of running a
 SPL project in large companies. However, very little reports exist that
 consider the situation for small to medium-sized enterprises and these
 studies try develop universal truths for SPL without lessons learned
 from empirical evidence need to be contextualized. This study is a step
 towards bridging this gap in contextual evidence by characterizing the
 weaknesses discovered in the scoping (SC) and requirements (RE)
 disciplines of SPL. Moreover, in this study we conducted a case study in
 a small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to justify the use of agile
 methods when introducing the SPL SC and RE disciplines through the
 characterization of their bottlenecks. The results of the
 characterization indicated that ineffective communication and
 collaboration, long iteration cycles, and the absence of adaptability
 and flexibility can increase the effort and reduce motivation during
 project development. These issues can be mitigated by agile methods. (C)

  Abstract                 = {{Software development has endured radical change with the introduction of
 agile methods for creating software solutions. This change has prompted
 new considerations of how software creation should be managed. While
 agile methods have changed software development processes, it would be
 premature to assume that has also induced modification in higher-level
 project management processes. Software development lifecycles (SDLC) and
 project management lifecycles (PLC), while associated, are not the same
 thing and it is still unclear to what degree the overarching project
 management tasks, tools or techniques must change or adapt to meet the
 needs of undertaking successful agile projects.
 This exploratory pilot study investigated agile methods used to manage
 software projects and was conducted via an online survey and restricted
 to a specific sample audience with significant project experience and
 with background in both traditional and agile development methods. The
 results indicate that traditional project management phases and
 techniques are adapted to fit with agile. However, as the discipline
 evolves the potential exists for a pure agile project management
 framework to surface - one that can be applied to better suit the needs
 of the management of agile projects as well as projects beyond the realm
 of software development.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Large software development projects involve multiple
 interconnected teams, often spread around the world, developing complex
 products for a growing number of customers and users. Succeeding with
 large-scale software development requires access to an enormous amount
 of knowledge and skills. Since neither individuals nor teams can
 possibly possess all the needed expertise, the resource availability in
 a team's knowledge network, also known as social capital, and effective
 knowledge coordination become paramount.
 Objective: In this paper, we explore the role of social capital in terms
 of knowledge networks and networking behavior in large-scale software
 development projects.
 Method: We conducted a multi-case study in two organizations, Ericsson
 and ABB, with software development teams as embedded units of analysis.
 We organized focus groups with ten software teams and surveyed 61
 members from these teams to characterize and visualize the teams'
 knowledge networks. To complement the team perspective, we conducted
 individual interviews with representatives of supporting and
 coordination roles. Based on survey data, data obtained from focus
 groups, and individual interviews, we compared the different network
 characteristics and mechanisms that support knowledge networks. We used
 social network analysis to construct the team networks, thematic coding
 to identify network characteristics and context factors, and tabular
 summaries to identify the trends.
 Results: Our findings indicate that social capital and networking are
 essential for both novice and mature teams when solving complex,
 unfamiliar, or interdependent tasks. Network size and networking
 behavior depend on company experience, employee turnover, team culture,
 need for networking, and organizational support. A number of mechanisms
 can support the development of knowledge networks and social capital,
 for example, introduction of formal technical experts, facilitation of
 communities of practice and adequate communication infrastructure.
 Conclusions: Our study emphasizes the importance of social capital and
 knowledge networks. Therefore, we suggest that, along with investments
 into training programs, software companies should also cultivate a
 networking culture to strengthen their social capital, a known driver of
 better performance. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

  Abstract                 = {{There is an increasing interest in the use of scientific workflows as a
 way to automate data management and model execution without requiring
 deep computing technical knowledge. Scientific workflows allow users to
 re-use previously developed code in multiple languages while providing
 repeatability and flexibility.
 Additional complexity is introduced when scientific workflows use code
 that is still in development, especially when the code development is
 not linked to workflow development. In this paper, within the context of
 a particular workflow engine, we look at existing tools for code re-use
 and techniques to manage the complexity of working with rapidly changing
 code.
 Hydrologist's Workbench (HWB) is a suite of tools, activities and
 recommendations built to support Microsoft's Project Trident, a
 scientific workflow engine. HWB contains several tools that assist in
 turning existing code into Trident Activities - atomic, composable,
 executable modules - via a process known as code ``wrapping{''}. The
 existing tools within HWB are designed to wrap code that is reasonably
 stable and unchanging and therefore these tools are insufficient for
 code that is subject to changes over time.
 We have investigated techniques to minimise the effort required to turn
 code under active development into Activities and workflows. The
 techniques include: an agile methodology for workflow and code
 co-development; treating the code as a dataset itself; using an agreed
 interface; dynamically generating then executing scripted code; a
 simplified, template-based Activity generation tool and manual
 transliteration. Issues around testing, versioning, integration and
 communication are also discussed}},

  Abstract                 = {{A model-based design workflow for embedded control systems can
 accelerate product development, improve performance, increase
 reliability, and reduce engineering cost. Several current technology
 trends are driving engineering organizations to establish model-based
 workflows that enable concurrent and collaborative engineering. In this
 way, embedded controls engineers can quickly develop reliable products
 of the highest performance. This paper discusses trends in automotive
 embedded controls and explains the use of model-based engineering
 workflows to accelerate embedded controls development. These trends
 include: platform-based requirements, systems/HW/SW codesign, agile
 methods, rapid prototyping needs, growing software content, integrated
 data systems, greater system complexity, and growing engineering needs.
 A model-based design workflow improves product development processes in
 the current engineering paradigm. Methods to accelerate development of
 model-based controls through the V cycle are described. Unconstrained
 prototyping with constrained design is shown as an effective means to
 converge on an implementation. Pros and cons of product development
 processes are contrasted. Model-based workflows provide a framework for
 controls engineers to incrementally create requirements, evaluate
 algorithms, develop architectures, coordinate designs, and facilitate
 requirements-based systems verification and validation testing. A
 framework that integrates requirements and testing improves system
 reliability and reduces development risks. Industry standards, such as
 ISO26262 and DO-178C, enforce such a framework. Tools and technologies
 that can be used to support modelbased development from functional
 requirements to automated testing are outlined. Readers gain an
 understanding of how to establish and deploy a model-based design
 workflow into their organizations to effectively and efficiently manage
 the development lifecycle of embedded controls.}},

 (RD) toward agile. However, it has also been spotted that agile
 methodologies are hardly ever followed in their pure form. Hybrid
 processes as combinations of RD and agile practices emerge. In addition,
 agile adoption has been reported to result in both benefits and
 limitations. This exploratory study (a) identifies development models
 based on RD and agile practice usage by practitioners; (b) identifies
 agile practice adoption scenarios based on eliciting practice usage over
 time; (c) prioritizes agile benefits and limitations in relation to (a)
 and (b). Practitioners provided answers through a questionnaire. The
 development models are determined using hierarchical cluster analysis.
 The use of practices over time is captured through an interactive board
 with practices and time indication sliders. This study uses the extended
 hierarchical voting analysis framework to investigate benefit and
 limitation prioritization. Four types of development models and six
 adoption scenarios have been identified. Overall, 45 practitioners
 participated in the prioritization study. A common benefit among all
 models and adoption patterns is knowledge and learning, while high
 requirements on professional skills were perceived as the main
 limitation. Furthermore, significant variances in terms of benefits and
 limitations have been observed between models and adoption patterns. The
 most significant internal benefit categories from adopting agile are
 knowledge and learning, employee satisfaction, social skill development,
 and feedback and confidence. Professional skill-specific demands,
 scalability, and lack of suitability for specific product domains are
 the main limitations of agile practice usage. Having a balanced agile
 process allows to achieve a high number of benefits. With respect to

  Abstract                 = {{The relevance of collaborative Product Development (PD) is rising with
 the decrease of product life cycles combined with growing customer
 demands. Industrial manufacturers now experience competition in the
 global market where differentiation is necessary for survival. Hence, in
 order to differentiate from low-cost competitors and increase PD
 performance, some industrial manufacturers now seek competitive
 advantage by experimenting with new ways for collaborative PD. This
 includes integrating customer-focused agile process models like Scrum
 from the software industry into their existing PD models. Thus, instead
 of replacing traditional stage-gate models, agile methods are currently
 integrated in existing PD models generating hybrid solution for
 collaborative PD. This paper includes a study of three industrial cases
 that have successfully integrated Scrum into the stage-gate process
 model for collaborative PD. The paper introduces the three functional
 hybrid models, including the impact on PD performance, PD roles and
 customer collaboration.}},

 adopt a selected subset of principles and practices based on their
 culture, their values, and the types of systems that they develop. More
 specifically, every organization or team implements a customized agile
 method, tailored to better accommodate its needs. However, the extent to
 which a customized method supports the organizational objectives, i.e.
 the `goodness' of that method, should be demonstrable. Existing agile
 assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses, or are limited in
 scope and application. In this research, we present a systematic,
 comprehensive approach to assessing the `goodness' of agile methods. We
 examine an agile method based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of
 the organization to support the adopted principles and practices
 specified by the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. We employ
 the Objectives, Principles and Strategies (OPS) Framework to guide our
 assessment process. The Framework (a) specifies objectives of the agile
 philosophy, (b) identifies principles that support the objectives, (c)
 designates strategies that implement the principles, (d) defines
 linkages that relate objectives to principles, and principles to
 strategies, and (e) prescribes indicators for assessing the extent to
 which an organization supports the implementation and effectiveness of
 those strategies. The propagation of indicator values along the linkages
 provides a multi-level assessment view of the agile method. In this
 paper, we discuss our assessment approach and substantiation results.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Background: Curriculum mapping, which is aimed at the systematic
 realignment of the planned, taught, and learned curriculum, is
 considered a challenging and ongoing effort in medical education.
 Second-generation curriculum managing systems foster knowledge
 management processes including curriculum mapping in order to give
 comprehensive support to learners, teachers, and administrators. The
 large quantity of custom-built software in this field indicates a
 shortcoming of available IT tools and standards.
 Objective: The project reported here aims at the systematic adoption of
 techniques and standards of the Social Semantic Web to implement
 collaborative curriculum mapping for a complete medical model
 curriculum.
 Methods: A semantic MediaWiki (SMW)-based Web application has been
 introduced as a platform for the elicitation and revision process of the
 Aachen Catalogue of Learning Objectives (ACLO). The semantic wiki uses a
 domain model of the curricular context and offers structured
 (form-based) data entry, multiple views, structured querying, semantic
 indexing, and commenting for learning objectives ({''}LOs{''}). Semantic
 indexing of learning objectives relies on both a controlled vocabulary
 of international medical classifications (ICD, MeSH) and a folksonomy
 maintained by the users. An additional module supporting the global
 checking of consistency complements the semantic wiki. Statements of the
 Object Constraint Language define the consistency criteria. We evaluated
 the application by a scenario-based formative usability study, where the
 participants solved tasks in the (fictional) context of 7 typical
 situations and answered a questionnaire containing Likert-scaled items
 and free-text questions.
 Results: At present, ACLO contains roughly 5350 operational (ie,
 specific and measurable) objectives acquired during the last 25 months.
 The wiki-based user interface uses 13 online forms for data entry and 4
 online forms for flexible searches of LOs, and all the forms are
 accessible by standard Web browsers. The formative usability study
 yielded positive results (median rating of 2 ({''}good{''}) in all 7
 general usability items) and produced valuable qualitative feedback,
 especially concerning navigation and comprehensibility. Although not
 asked to, the participants (n=5) detected critical aspects of the
 curriculum (similar learning objectives addressed repeatedly and missing
 objectives), thus proving the system's ability to support curriculum
 revision.
 Conclusions: The SMW-based approach enabled an agile implementation of
 computer-supported knowledge management. The approach, based on standard
 Social Semantic Web formats and technology, represents a feasible and
 effectively applicable compromise between answering to the individual
 requirements of curriculum management at a particular medical school and
 using proprietary systems.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Practitioners and researchers often claim that agile methods
 have moved into the mainstream for the last few years. To support this
 claim they refer to recent industrial surveys which tend to report high
 rates of agile method usage. However many of these industrial surveys
 are conducted by agile consultants, tool vendors, professional societies
 and independent technology and market research organizations. This
 raises some important concerns about the possible conflict of interest
 and the overall trustworthiness of these studies.
 Objective: In response to the above concerns, a secondary study was
 carried out. Its objective was to examine industrial surveys published
 in 2011 and 2012, determine the extent to which we could trust their
 reported high rates of agile method usage and provide recommendations on
 how quality of research could be improved in the future.
 Method: Following a rigorous search procedure, nine industrial surveys
 on agile method usage published in 2011 and 2012 were extracted from
 both academia and industry. Their thoroughness in reporting and
 trustworthiness were evaluated using a newly proposed assessment
 framework based on Guba's four attributes of trustworthiness (truth
 value, applicability, consistency and neutrality) and a number of
 methods for assessing survey research in related fields as information,
 communication and management studies.
 Results: The careful examination of the reviewed surveys shows that most
 of the studies have insufficient thoroughness in reporting and
 (subsequently) low trustworthiness. Only one (out of nine) study is
 considered as a scientific contribution in determining the current
 2011/2012 rate of agile method usage.
 Conclusions: The obtained results support our initial considerations
 about the trustworthiness of recent industrial surveys on agile method
 usage and suggest a number of recommendations for increasing the quality
 and value of future survey research in this regard. (C) 2014 Elsevier

  Abstract                 = {{Purpose - In today's globalized, networked and fast-changing
 environment, knowledge became invaluable asset for everyone - students,
 workers, and organizations. Life-long learning became crucial to the
 future of our society. In order to foster more effective and
 collaborative learning and knowledge exchange it is necessary to utilize
 modern information technologies and services. If used in the right way,
 information technology can transform and energize educational process,
 stimulate learning in anyplace and anytime, promote creative thinking,
 and make better use of existing individual and organizational resources.
 The rationale of this paper is to introduce the innovative open
 educational model and supporting software system which is capable to
 answer the major challenges of modern education.
 Design/ methodology/approach - Although modern web technologies and open
 educational resources (OER) have great potential to bring new
 opportunities for learning and knowledge exchange, at the same time,
 developing successful OER systems is very challenging. Design of an
 innovative and open learning software environments needs a holistic
 approach, which comprises specific methodology, software architecture,
 and various services, applications and tools. This paper describes
 methodological approach, software architecture, services and features of
 the innovative software solution, which address important issues that
 face organizations when designing and implementing OER systems. The
 modular design and composite architecture enable flexibility in terms of
 the infrastructure and platform, available services, scalability, and
 integration.
 Originality/value - Traditional educational systems cannot completely
 meet current educational requirements. On the other hand, many of the
 existing OER and e-learning initiatives didn't fulfil high expectations.
 The OER model proposed in this paper provides a novel approach to design
 and utilization of different cutting-edge technologies that are
 seamlessly combined to provide flexibility, scalability,
 personalization, collaboration, content management, searching, and
 social networking. The proposed OER model and software platform enables
 creation of agile and adaptable educational ecosystem that can transform
 the learning experience, and connect individuals, educational
 institutions and companies.
 Practical implications - The presented OER software architecture is
 multi-layered and seamlessly combines various services and technologies
 that enable creation of integrated and feature-rich open educational
 environments. It is a flexible, customizable, and extensible software
 environment that can support various OER scenarios. The new application
 model and software solution are architected and designed in such a way
 to provide the following advancements in terms of: alignment, agility,
 adaptivity, manageability, functionality, interoperability, performance,
 and security. This enables establishing flexible, adaptable,
 cost-effective and sustainable OER environment where individuals,
 educational institutions, companies and government collaborate, create,
 share and discover learning resources and knowledge.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Although the agile software development approaches have gained wide
 acceptance in practice, the concerns regarding the scalability and
 integration of agile approaches in traditional system development
 organizations have remained. The difficulty of adopting agile practices
 increases when there is a need to scale these practices. Scaled Agile
 Framework (SAFe) has emerged as a solution to address some of these
 concerns. Despite few encouraging results of SAFe adoption, case studies
 indicate several challenges of SAFe adoption. Currently, there is a lack
 of a well-structured gradual approach for implementing and establishing
 SAFe. Before and during SAFe adoption, organizations require a uniform
 model for assessing the current state and progress, and for establishing
 a roadmap for the initiative. To address this need, we developed a
 maturity model for adopting agile and SAFe practices. Taking an existing
 agile maturity model as the basis, we extended the model with practices
 that are key to scaling agile practices for the SAFe. The model is
 developed and refined using a Delphi study. Subsequently, a case study
 was conducted in a large organization where the model was applied to
 assess the maturity level of the organization in adopting SAFe.}},

 software developers a working test framework early with respect to
 traditional software development methods e.g. waterfall model. In this
 paper, an approach of developing test automation software with closed
 collaboration with product development team is discussed. The proposed
 method modifies the Agile Development method with scrum by introducing
 few meetings for combined teams working for development of software

 summarize related researches and explain the advantages brought by
 adopting SDN in wireless networks. Then, potential challenges are
 analyzed base on operation data in a large-scale WLAN. What can be found
 is that the challenges are either different or more severe than problems
 of SDN in wired networks because of special characteristics in wireless
 and mobile environment. In addition, several existing proposals and
 potential methods concerning on scalability problems are introduced. The
 analyses in this paper could provide some hints when applying the SDN
 concept into an operation wireless network.}},

 to build a highly agile Information Technology (IT) infrastructure. For

 increased agility, policy-based management, and network management bond
 to more liberal IT workflow systems. To address the sustainability
 problems, SDN needs to provide greater collaboration and tighter
 integration with networks, servers, and security teams that will have an
 impact on how enterprises design, plan, deploy and manage networks. In
 this paper, we propose FS-OpenSecurity, which is a new and pragmatic
 security architecture model. It consists of two novel methodologies,
 Software Defined Orchestrator (SDO) and SQUEAK, which offer a robust and
 secure architecture. The secure architecture is required for protection
 from diverse threats. Usually, security administrators need to handle
 each threat individually. However, handling threats automatically by
 adapting to the threat landscape is a critical demand. Therefore, the
 architecture must handle defensive processes automatically that are
 collaboratively based on intelligent external and internal information.}},

 Empirically the research examines the emerging challenges in software
 companies' strategy process when they are pursuing continuous practices
 in software development. The tentative analysis revealed that the
 practices that stem from the more traditional, structured strategy
 process are not compatible with the more ``continuous
 planning{''}-oriented organisational practices. Thus, there seems to be
 pressure for developing more continuous strategy process and practices.
 Furthermore, in other organisational processes, especially in team

 However, it is generally agreed that cloud computing, network function

 together ensures several advantages in terms of network configuration
 flexibility, scalability, and elasticity, which are highly needed to
 fulfill the numerous requirements of 5G. Furthermore, 5G network
 management procedures should be as simple as possible, allowing network
 operators to orchestrate and manage the lifecycle of their virtual
 network infrastructures (VNIs) and the corresponding virtual network
 functions (VNFs), in a cognitive and programmable fashion. To this end,
 we introduce the concept of ``Anything as a Service{''} (ANYaaS), which
 allows a network operator to create and orchestrate 5G services on
 demand and in a dynamic way. ANYaaS relies on the reference ETSI NFV
 architecture to orchestrate and manage important services such as mobile
 Content Delivery Network as a Service (CDNaaS), Traffic Offload as a
 Service (TOFaaS), and Machine Type Communications as a Service (MTCaaS).
 Ultimately, ANYaaS aims for enabling dynamic creation and management of

 used as a base for the software project life-cycle since 1990s, the
 number of studies that follow a sound empirical method and
 quantitatively reveal the effect of using these models over Traditional
 models is scarce.
 Objective: This article explains the empirical method of and the results
 from systematic analyses and comparison of development performance and
 product quality of Incremental Process and Agile Process adapted in two
 projects of a middle-size, telecommunication software development
 company. The Incremental Process is an adaption of the Waterfall Model
 whereas the newly introduced Agile Process is a combination of the
 Unified Software Development Process, Extreme Programming, and Scrum.
 Method: The method followed to perform the analyses and comparison is
 benefited from the combined use of qualitative and quantitative methods.
 It utilizes; GQM Approach to set measurement objectives, CMMI as the
 reference model to map the activities of the software development
 processes, and a predefined assessment approach to verify consistency of
 process executions and evaluate measure characteristics prior to
 quantitative analysis.
 Results: The results of the comparison showed that the Agile Process had
 performed better than the Incremental Process in terms of productivity
 (79\%), defect density (57\%), defect resolution effort ratio (26\%),
 Test Execution V\&V Effectiveness (21\%), and effort prediction
 capability (4\%). These results indicate that development performance
 and product quality achieved by following the Agile Process was superior
 to those achieved by following the Incremental Process in the projects
 compared.
 Conclusion: The acts of measurement, analysis, and comparison enabled
 comprehensive review of the two development processes, and resulted in
 understanding their strengths and weaknesses. The comparison results
 constituted objective evidence for organization-wide deployment of the
 Agile Process in the company. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

 is traditionally one of ``command and control{''} but Agile methods
 require a more facilitative approach. How this changing role plays out
 in practice is not yet clearly understood. The purpose of this paper is
 to provide insight into how adopting Agile techniques shape the working
 practices of PMs and critically reflect on some of the tensions that
 arise.
 Design/methodology/approach - An ethnographic approach was used to
 surface a richer understanding of the issues and tensions faced by PMs
 as Agile methods are introduced. Ethnographic fiction conveys the story
 to a wider audience.
 Findings - Agile approaches shift responsibility and spread expert
 knowledge seeming to undermine the traditional PM function. However, the
 findings here show various scenarios that allow PMs to wrest control and
 become more of a ``gate-keeper{''}. Ethnographic fiction communicates a
 sense of the PMs frustration with the conflict between the need to
 control and the desire for teams to take more responsibility.
 Originality/value - Stories provide insight and communicate the
 experiential feel behind issues faced by PMs adopting Agile to surface
 useful knowledge. The objective is not how to measure knowledge, but how
 to recognize it. These reflections are valuable to fellow researchers as
 well as practitioners and contribute to the growing literature on Agile
 project management.}},

 development and economical feasible software also increases. The new
 software development techniques and models are coming to picture to
 solve the problems of rapid changing requirements. Agile methodology is
 one of the approaches to fulfill the current business requirements,
 which is flexible to adapt the change at any phase of development.
 Feature driven development (FDD) is an agile based process model based
 on feature development, adapted by many organizations. The limitation of
 agile process is its incapability to reuse components those are
 developed through agile processes. Adopting reuse is a challenging task
 but it can be used at an initial level by integrating with various
 development processes. Reuse oriented development of software is
 considered to be one of the most efficient techniques to improve
 software quality as it increases the productivity and reduces the
 development effort and cost. This paper purposes a reengineered Feature
 driven reuse development (FDRD) process model which integrate reuse
 concept with feature driven development process model. The model
 improves the productivity of organization and quality of the produced
 product.}},

 successful software development, and a considerable number of published
 studies the (successful) use of agile methods and reports on the
 benefits companies have from adopting agile methods. Yet, since the
 world is not black or white, the question for what happened to the
 traditional models arises. Are traditional models replaced by agile
 methods? How is the transformation toward Agile managed, and, moreover,
 where did it start? With this paper we close a gap in literature by
 studying the general process use over time to investigate how
 traditional and agile methods are used. Is there coexistence or do agile
 methods accelerate the traditional processes' extinction? The findings
 of our literature study comprise two major results: First, studies and
 reliable numbers on the general process model use are rare, i.e., we
 lack quantitative data on the actual process use and, thus, we often
 lack the ability to ground process-related research in practically
 relevant issues. Second, despite the assumed dominance of agile methods,
 our results clearly show that companies enact context-specific hybrid
 solutions in which traditional and agile development approaches are used
 in combination.}},

 management, with a focus on norms and human resources. SEAC is

 an incremental and agile process model, which produces small and
 frequent releases of new, incremental modules that replace a portion of

 Since the SEAC software handles business activities that are highly
 dependent on norms, such as the contracts of employees, the taxation of
 incomes and salaries, the pension contributions, one of the key
 challenges is to support a smooth transformation of norms into
 requirements, into code and eventually into test cases used to verify
 that norms have been implemented as prescribed by the law. The SE
 research unit at FBK has been involved to introduce a set of practices
 aimed at supporting such transformation, so as to improve the current

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Agile approaches are an alternative for organizations
 developing software, particularly for those who develop Web
 applications. Besides, CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)
 models are well-established approaches focused on assessing the maturity
 of an organization that develops software. Web Engineering is the field
 of Software Engineering responsible for analyzing and studying the
 specific characteristics of the Web. The suitability of an Agile
 approach to help organizations reach a certain CMMI maturity level in
 Web environments will be very interesting, as they will be able to keep
 the ability to quickly react and adapt to changes as long as their
 development processes get mature.
 Objective: This paper responds to whether it is feasible or not, for an
 organization developing Web systems, to achieve a certain maturity level
 of the CMMI-DEV model using Agile methods.
 Method: The proposal is analyzed by means of a systematic literature
 review of the relevant approaches in the field, defining a
 characterization schema in order to compare them to introduce the
 current state-of-the-art.
 Results: The results achieved after the systematic literature review are
 presented, analyzed and compared against the defined schema, extracting
 relevant conclusions for the different dimensions of the problem:
 compatibility, compliance, experience, maturity and Web.
 Conclusion: It is concluded that although the definition of an Agile
 approach to meet the different CMMI maturity levels goals could be
 possible for an organization developing Web systems, there is still a
 lack of detailed studies and analysis on the field. (C) 2015 Elsevier

 software engineering (SE), is seldom cited as the most engaging part of
 a software engineer's training. In spite of its importance, it was often
 a neglected area, and only recently, with the adoption of more agile
 methodologies, has testing come to the fore. Testers face challenges,
 including the need to be able to identify when software is not behaving
 as expected. Metamorphic Testing (MT) first appeared twenty years ago in
 an effort to help testers facing the oracle problem (not having a
 mechanism to determine correct software behavior). Although MT is simple
 in concept, it has demonstrated very impressive fault-finding ability,
 and has recently been attracting a great deal of interest. Training
 students and practitioners to effectively apply MT has become an
 important goal, but to date, no textbook or guidelines have been made
 readily available. This paper, written by some of the leading voices in
 the MT community, is a sharing of some of the experiences, reflections
 and insights gained through teaching MT (and other related subjects).
 These experiences indicate that not only is MT effective in industry and
 at fault-finding, it has the potential to really engage students in
 creative SE classroom activities.}},

 application developers as medical device software is normally developed
 with a focus upon producing the regulatory documentation that is
 essential to market such devices. Regulatory compliance is usually
 achieved by adopting a plan-driven software development approach, which
 is not typically the method used to develop mobile applications.

 integrates processes from various medical device software and generic

  Abstract                 = {{To achieve the maximum productivity using minimum resource is the aim of
 any software industry. Software engineering provides an abstraction
 process to develop software product. It has introduced various
 methodologies, principles and concepts. Most of them are the software
 process models which are also known as software life cycle models. In
 the software industry different-different types of projects (small,
 medium, large, complex) arrive in random inter arrival time for
 development of software products. Before implementing the products,
 project managers decide an appropriated software process model in
 documentation that is used in production of products. An empirical study
 conducted in 2012 that presents various effecting factors for selecting
 any software life cycle model. One of the important factors is team
 size. Software industry has a development team which works in
 co-ordination and depends on each other. Sometimes project managers are
 not intelligently assigned resources to particular phases of software
 life cycle model. Therefore to overcome these issues we are simulating
 iterative waterfall and incremental model to determine optimal resources
 for every phase of software life cycle model. This study shall enable
 the project manager to determine optimal resource without implementing
 software product. As future work, we shall be simulating spiral and
 iterative incremental model to determine which SDLC model is more
 appropriate for software industry.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Context: Agile software development projects often manage user
 requirements with models that are called user stories. Every good user
 story has to be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and
 testable. A proper understanding of a user story also requires an
 understanding of its dependencies. The lack of explicit representation
 of such dependencies presumably leads to missing information regarding
 the context of a user story.
 Objective: We propose a method that facilitates better understanding of
 execution order and integration dependencies of user stories by making
 use of business process models. The method associates user stories with
 the corresponding business process model activity element.
 Method: We adopted a situational method engineering approach to define
 our proposed method. In order to provide understanding of proposed
 method's constructs we used ontological concepts. Our method associates
 a user story to an activity element. In this way, the business process
 model can be used to infer information about the execution order and
 integration dependencies of the user story. We defined three levels of
 association granularity: a user story can be more abstract,
 approximately equal to, or more detailed than its associated business
 process model activity element. In our experiment we evaluate each of
 these three levels.
 Results: Our experiment uses a between-subject design. We applied
 comprehension, problem-solving and recall tasks to evaluate the
 hypotheses. The statistical results provide support for all of the
 hypotheses. Accordingly, there appears to be significantly greater
 understanding of the execution order and integration dependencies of
 user stories when associated business process models are available.
 Conclusions: We addressed a problem which arises from managing user
 stories in software development projects and focuses on the missing
 context of a user story. Our method contributes to the discipline of
 conceptual modeling in agile development. Our experiment provides
 empirical insight into requirement dependencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {{The article presents a new pricing model applied in Scrum contracting.
 The model will introduce an innovative approach to the promotion of
 software products with reference to their pricing-bounding non-profit
 features with the classical cost estimation. It will assume a principle
 of single charge for all components reused in products created for
 different customers. The model will be applicable mainly in
 multi-project Scrum environments, but will also support scaled
 multi-team Scrum development environments (where software development
 work is allocated to different Scrum teams). It will introduce a
 complete mechanism for cost estimation, with component pricing
 procedures (compatible with Scrum estimation methodologies), component
 reuse tracking and so on. The price offered for software to be developed
 will depend on its popularity among customers. So, the introduction of a
 new feature triggered by one customer can be beneficial for all parties
 taking part in the framework development, with justified share of the
 price. In such situations a common base for software development pricing
 techniques must be established. It will depend on different factors,
 such as: team effort, team velocities, resources and technologies used.
 To express these values a reference currency will be defined. The model,
 along with pricing mechanisms presented in the article, can be
 effectively used in many software products in which software evolution
 is a core. The pricing efficiency, commonly recognized as a feature of
 the model, will encourage potential customers to choose a software
 company that uses it.}},

 This means that work practices and challenges that practitioners face

 critical in ISD. However, IS literature is silent on how to manage
 requirements-related risks in the practice of continuous IS development.
 To fill this gap, we propose a continuous requirements risk profiling

 collection to support the method development. The developed method can
 be integrated to ISD projects using different continuous ISD methods.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper highlights the importance of systematic agile service
 engineering for Industrial Internet and Industrie 4.0 software
 applications. Here, the functional and non-functional requirements of IT
 users (mostly from the disciplines of mechanical engineering and
 electrical engineering) need to be mapped to the capabilities of
 emerging service platforms. The capabilities of service platforms are
 usually described, structured and formalized by software architects.
 However, very often, their description does not fit to the language of
 the user. This complicates the transition from requirements analysis to
 system design. The paper describes how this `gap' may be closed with
 help of a service-oriented analysis and design (SOAD) methodology
 entitled SERVUS and a corresponding Web-based collaborative tool that
 supports the documentation according to the SERVUS design methodology.
 SERVUS denotes a Design Methodology for Information Systems based upon
 Service-oriented Architectures and the Modelling of Use Cases and
 Capabilities as Resources. It describes individual design activities
 interconnected by a common modelling environment (based upon the REST
 principles) combining several viewpoints of architectural reference

  Abstract                 = {{Accommodating new requirements and user driven features is the major
 challenge of engineered resilient systems. An enterprise-centric
 system-engineering paradigm provides a holistic framework for guiding
 future growth of systems. This paradigm requires new processes to
 support such growth. Traditional system engineering approaches, while
 helpful in developing system structure and framework, are not adaptive
 to future growth. New user desired features or requirements can be added
 to legacy systems, but typically entail unfortunate tradeoffs. To meet
 new requirements, engineered resilient systems have adopted a hybrid
 approach of using traditional and agile system engineering. Traditional
 system engineering approaches handle original concept development and
 design requirements, while the specific implementation is agile. The
 hybrid approach presents some application issues such as abstraction
 (how much of the systems should be designed before agile
 implementation). Others include how to facilitate user features
 requiring major design changes; and what are acceptable tradeoffs. These
 issues are particularly problematic during verification and validation
 phases when a system fails to meet a particular requirement, which
 necessitates a design change. In this paper, we present a real world
 case study of a large-scale data processing and analysis system. Design
 and implementation of this system took place over two years using a mix
 of traditional and agile system engineering approaches. This paper
 presents the current best practices, customization, and the issues of
 abstraction, design agility, user accommodation, and tradeoffs while
 using hybrid system engineering approaches. We include lessons learned
 from the case study and suggest future guidelines. (C) 2014 The Authors.

  Abstract                 = {{As part of Agile transformation in past few years we have seen IT
 organizations adopting continuous integration principles in their
 software delivery lifecycle, which has improved the efficiency of
 development teams. With the time it has been realized that this
 optimization as part of continuous integration - alone - is just not
 helping to make the entire delivery lifecycle efficient or is not
 driving the organization efficiency. Unless all the pieces of a software
 delivery lifecycle work like a well oiled machine - efficiency of
 organization to optimize the delivery lifecycle can not be met. This is
 the problem which DevOps tries to address. This paper tries to cover all
 aspects of Devops applicable to various phases of SDLC and specifically
 talks about business need, ways to move from continuous integration to
 continuous delivery and its benefits. Continuous delivery transformation
 in this paper is explained with a real life case study that how
 infrastructure can be maintained just in form of code (IAAC). Finally
 this paper touches upon various considerations one must evaluate before
 adopting DevOps and what kind of benefits one can expect.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Many software development organisations today adopt global software
 engineering (GSE) and agile models; requiring software engineers to
 collaborate and develop software in flexible, distributed, online teams.
 However, many employers have expressed concern that graduates lack
 teamwork skills and one of the most commonly occurring problems with GSE
 models are issues with project management. Team managers and educators
 often oversee a number of teams and the large corpus of data, in
 combination with agile models, make it difficult to efficiently assess
 factors such as team role distribution and emotional climate.
 Current methods and tools for monitoring software engineering (SE)
 teamwork in both industry and education settings typically focus on
 member contributions, reflection, or product outcomes, which are limited
 in terms of real-time feedback and accurate behavioural analysis. We
 have created a dashboard that extracts and communicates team role
 distribution and team emotion information in real-time. Our proof of
 concept provides a real-time analysis of teamwork discussions and
 visualises team member emotions, the roles they have adopted and overall
 team sentiment during the course of a collaborative problem-solving
 project. We demonstrate and discuss how such a tool could be useful for
 SE team management and training and the development of teamwork skills
 in SE university courses.}},

 deteriorate the business value delivered in such value chains. The
 objective of our study is to support enterprises that suffer from such
 dependencies with a governance framework that helps them mitigate
 collaboration issues between sets of codependent Scrum teams. We first
 identify a set of intervention actions that aim to mitigate the
 collaboration issues between codependent Scrum teams. Second, we
 validate the effectiveness of these intervention actions in a large
 confirmatory industrial case study. This study was held in a large
 multi-national financial institute that worked with a large number of
 codependent Scrum teams. Third, we triangulate the findings in three
 focus groups. We finally package the intervention actions in a
 governance framework. The intervention actions led to a delivery time
 reduction from 29 days to 10 days. The participants in the focus groups
 confirmed the causality between the intervention actions and the
 observed delivery improvement. The empirical results show that the
 intervention actions, packaged in the governance framework, enable
 codependent sets of Scrum teams to deliver faster. (C) 2015 Elsevier

 industries increasingly adopt Agile/Scrum to swiftly change IT
 functionality because of rapid changing business demands. IT
 functionality in large enterprises however is typically delivered by a
 portfolio of interdependent software applications involving a chain of
 Scrum teams. Usually, each application from the portfolio is allocated
 to a single Scrum team, which necessitates collaboration between the
 Scrum teams to jointly deliver functionality.
 Objective: Identify the collaboration related issues in chains of Scrum
 teams.
 Method: We used a qualitative approach with transcripted interviews from
 three case studies that were coded and analyzed to identify the issues.
 Results: We identified six issues in chains of codependent Scrum teams;
 coordination, prioritization, alignment, automation, predictability and
 visibility. The synthesis of these issues with existing theory resulted
 in nine propositions. These nine propositions have been combined into a
 conceptual model.
 Conclusion: We propose this conceptual model as a starting point for a
 governance framework to manage chains of Scrum teams that addresses the
 identified issues. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Today's Internet requires easily manageable, and simply extensible
 network control systems, which we can't say about the current networks.
 Software-Defined Networking (SDN) {[}1] is an emerging architecture what
 aims to create a system for the upcoming needs, by offering a directly
 programmable, agile, centrally managed, and programatically configured
 way for the operators to control their network {[}2]. SDN decouples the
 network control and forwarding functions, which makes it easier to
 create new abstractions in networking, simplifying management and making
 network advancement easier.
 SDN devices are programmable through a dedicated interface, with a
 specific protocol, from which the most known is actually OpenFlow {[}3].
 The biggest problem with OpenFlow is that it does not support new header
 definitions, which is necessary for network operators to apply new
 packet encapsulations. To overcome these issues with OpenFlow, a new
 high-level language has been created: Programming Protocol-independent
 Packet Processors (P4) {[}4]. This language supports a fully
 programmable parser, which makes us able to define new headers without
 problem.
 However there are a lot of opportunities to do with P4, we focused on
 the network security field. In this paper we introduce the first
 security middleware programmed and configured in P4. Our software works
 as a layer 3 firewall, with protocol, and port filtering, flood attack
 detection, and the ability to make decisions about Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6,
 TCP, UDP header fields.}},

  Abstract                 = {{In this paper we examine the integration of usability activities into a
 large inter-organisational agile development project.
 Inter-organisational agile projects possess unique attributes. They
 involve multiple stakeholders from different organisational contexts and
 are thus characterised by competing priorities. Team members also lack a
 mutual awareness of what constitutes work. These issues make the
 collaboration between project teams challenging. Meanwhile collaboration
 between usability designers and agile project teams is an integral part
 of the integration of usability activities into agile development
 projects. We carried out an interpretive case study on a large
 inter-organisational agile development project to examine how usability
 designers and agile project teams collaborate in this project type.
 Results showed integration goals were achieved through five tactics
 deployed by the usability designers. These tactics were negotiating
 inclusion; upward influencing, placating expert users, establishing
 credibility and diffusing designs. The implications of these findings
 are summarised in the form of three propositions that pertain to how
 usability designer agile project team collaborations might be organised
 in agile development projects. Further, the role of the usability
 designer in ensuring the integration of usability activities is also
 emphasised. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

 are not fully understood, being difficult to elicit and produce accurate
 conceptual models more efficiently. We have been investigating how
 creative models and model-driven development can contribute to overcome

 cognitive support to rapidly produce conceptual models that are closer
 to stakeholders' expectations. This paper reports on the results of a
 controlled experiment carried out in academia and industry using a
 creative and agile modeling approach. This approach uses mind maps to
 generate conceptual models through transformations, using model-driven

 security protection. However, the rigid control mechanism of current
 security middleboxes induces inflexible orchestration, limiting the
 agile and on-demand security provision in virtualized datacenters. This
 paper presents Tualatin, a consolidated framework of delivering security
 services in multi-tenant datacenters. It meets security requirements of
 different scenarios by hardware and software co-design. Leveraging
 Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and OpenFlow techniques, Tualatin
 provides fine-grained security protection in dynamically changing
 network topologies, where both switches and security middleboxes are
 programmatically controlled by logically centralized controllers. With
 service-level APIs exposed, Tualatin could be easily integrated with
 other Cloud Management System (CMS). A proof-of-concept system has been
 deployed in a Tier-IV datacenter, providing customizable network
 security services for tenant Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Agile methodologies are becoming widespread in modern software
 development. However, due to a lack of safety assurance activities,
 agile methods are criticized for being inadequate for the development of
 safe software. Safety analysis and safety verification are complementary
 methods for safety assurance. Yet, both usually rely on traditional,
 waterfall-like processes. Therefore, it is strongly needed to integrate
 an appropriate safety analysis approach into agile software development
 processes driving architecture design and verify the safe design at the
 code level.
 This paper presents a novel agile process model ``S-Scrum{''} based on
 the existing development process ``Safe Scrum{''} and extended by a
 safety analysis method and a safety verification approach based on STPA
 (System-Theoretic Process Analysis).
 The proposed agile development process S-Scrum can be separated into
 three parts: (1) performing safety-guided design by STPA inside each
 sprint. (2) Verifying safety requirements at the code level by using
 model checking. (3) Replacing traditional RAMS (Reliability,
 Availability, Maintainability, Safety) validation on the final product
 by STPA safety analysis. We adopt other aspects from the original Safe
 Scrum.
 Finally, the feasibility of S-Scrum is illustrated with the example of
 an airbag system.}},

 Project Management Methodologies (PMMs), there is only scant research
 examining how and why organisations select agile approaches for managing

 projects. This paper reports on the findings of such research conducted
 within the context of a large technology-focused case organisation. The
 findings identify significant variance between business lines,
 specifically between product development and software development
 functions and their ability to follow agile guidelines. Generally across
 the organisation there was limited evidence of tailoring to context, an
 important organisational success factor, yet there was a more
 significant level of tailoring and responsiveness to client needs and
 wishes. Overall, there was a lack of clarity about the location of the
 decoupling points following the scoping of the project. Recommendations
 therefore require further attention and understanding of the
 implications of new practices employed by organisations, not least by
 senior management and for additional research underpinning such
 discovery.}},

 relationship often existing between their IT division and other business
 units. To aid in overcoming this problem, we present the innovation and
 IT posture framework. The framework identifies the four different levels
 of posture IT divisions typically adopt in enterprises and the various
 stages of maturity in each posture. Our key message is that fertile
 ground for IT-driven innovation will only emerge when the IT posture
 aligns with what the rest of the enterprise expects. Based on our
 research and consulting work, we also offer five key lessons that will
 enable CIOs and innovation leaders to overcome these collaboration
 shortcomings and deliver real IT-driven innovations.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Deciding the optimal project scope that fulfills the needs of the most
 important stakeholders is challenging due to a plethora of aspects that
 may impact decisions. Large companies that operate in rapidly changing
 environments experience frequently changing customer needs which force
 decision makers to continuously adjust the scope of their projects.
 Change intensity is further fueled by fierce market competition and hard
 time-to-market deadlines. Staying in control of the changes in thousands
 of features becomes a major issue as information overload hinders
 decision makers from rapidly extracting relevant information. This paper
 presents a visual technique, called Feature Survival Charts+ (FSC+),
 designed to give a quick and effective overview of the requirements
 scoping process for Very Large-Scale Requirements Engineering (VLSRE).
 FSC+ were applied at a large company with thousands of features in the
 database and supported the transition from plan-driven to a more dynamic
 and change-tolerant release scope management process. FSC+ provides
 multiple views, filtering, zooming, state-change intensity views, and
 support for variable time spans. Moreover, this paper introduces five
 decision archetypes deduced from the dataset and subsequently analyzed
 and the atomic decision visualization that shows the frequency of
 various decisions in the process. The capabilities and usefulness of
 FSC+, decision patterns (state changes that features undergo) and atomic
 decision visualizations are evaluated through interviews with
 practitioners who found utility in all techniques and indicated that
 their inherent flexibility was necessary to meet the varying needs of
 the stakeholders.}},

 current 6 billion to 9-11 billion people in 2050. This faces us with an
 enormous challenge to feed this population and still keep production
 within the limits of planet Earth's carrying capacity. Smart Farming -
 i.e. the use of smart, data-rich ICT-services and applications, in
 combination with advanced hardware (in tractors, greenhouses, etc.) -
 can provide the much needed breakthroughs to producing enough good
 quality food in a safe and environmental-sound way. This paper
 introduces a Future Internet platform - called FIspace for business to
 business collaboration that is currently being developed within Europe's
 Future Internet Public-Private Partnership programme (FI-PPP). On top of
 that a specific implementation will be made for the area of Smart
 Farming that will enable a global approach for Apps and Services
 development. It is expected that this will overcome many of the current
 bottlenecks in ICT development for Smart Farming such as
 interoperability and handling large amounts of data, and that it will
 lead to more agile and affordable software solutions. In this way, this
 development can contribute to the global challenge of producing enough
 safe and healthy food for the future within planet Earth's carrying
 capacity. New projects are planned and collaboration in Europe and
 beyond should further leverage the platform. The ambition is to become
 world-leading in this area.}},

 of a high-performance software-based network that is flexible,
 lower-cost, and agile, a fast and carefully designed network function
 virtualization platform along with a comprehensive SDN control plane is
 needed. The shift toward software-based network services broadens the
 type of networking capabilities offered in provider networks and cloud
 platforms by allowing network services to be dynamically deployed across
 shared hosts. Combining this with an SDN control plane that recognizes
 the power of a dynamically changing network infrastructure allows
 network functions to be placed when they are needed and where they are
 most appropriate in the network. Our system, SDNFV harmoniously combines
 the two fast moving technological directions of SDN and virtualization
 to further the goal of achieving a true software-based network.}},

 due to conflating two entirely different meanings of ``agile.{''} We
 therefore unpack these two meanings and present our tentative

 emerges from a dialectic interplay between recognizing and responding to
 needs for changes. Meanwhile, rather than directly affecting success,
 agility moderates the negative effects of need for change on success.
 Viewing agility this way helps address the research-practice gap by
 highlighting the need for skepticism of methods and practices, and by
 suggesting practically relevant research questions.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Global software development (GSD) is gaining ever more relevance.
 Although communication is key in the exchange of information between
 team members, multi-site software development has introduced additional
 obstacles (different time-zones and cultures, IT infrastructure, etc.)
 and delays into the act of communication, which is already problematic.
 Communication is even more critical in the case of Agile Global Software
 Development (AGSD) in which communication plays a primary role. This
 paper reports an exploratory study of the effects of tools supporting
 communication in AGSD. More precisely, this paper analyses the
 perception of team members about communication infrastructures in AGSD.
 The research question to which this study responds concerns how
 development teams perceive the communication infrastructure while
 developing products using agile methodologies. Most previous studies
 have dealt with communication support from a highly technological media
 tool perspective. In this research work, instead, observations were
 obtained from three perspectives: communication among team members,
 communication of the status of the development process, and
 communication of the status of the progress of the product under
 development. It has been possible to show that team members perceive
 advantages to using media tools that make them feel in practice that
 teams are co-located, such as smartboards supported by efficient
 video-tools, and combining media tools with centralized repository
 tools, with information from the process development and product
 characteristics, that allow distributed teams to effectively share
 information about the status of the project/process/product during the
 development process in order to overcome some of the still existing
 problems in communication in AGSD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  Abstract                 = {{Agile development requires a highly iterative and collaborative design
 process, which relies on the successful interpretation of software
 development activities amongst team members throughout the overall
 process. However, contemporary methods and tools that support agile
 efforts provide little help in addressing context-specific tacit
 knowledge, which is difficult to externalize without a shared method of
 interpretation. Without a continuously updated interpretation of the
 project vision, it is difficult to claim a shared mental model, while
 this is actually vital for the success of an agile process. In this
 paper, we address this issue and seek guidance in an approach that is
 commonly used in film storycraft. Film production has ample experience
 with externalizing experiences with the help of visual planning tools
 and related techniques to orchestrate the creative efforts of vast
 interdisciplinary production teams. We therefore propose that methods
 and tools from visual storycrafting can be adapted to assist software
 developers, not only with externalizing and discussing context-specific
 tacit knowledge but also to keep them creatively engaged in the
 development process.}},

 Secondly, we employed a cross-sectional survey approach to explore the
 company personnel's opinions regarding the changes in the process. The
 survey data was collected from 30 practitioners who were working for the
 same project in a software development organization in a technology
 research centre. The descriptive statistics were calculated with paired
 sample t-tests being used to compare for integration process that
 contains three stages (i) initial stage, (ii) Scrumban stage, (iii)
 Scrumban with integrated Gamification stage. The preliminary results of

 Based on OFDM, a novel architecture named flexible grid optical network
 has been proposed, and becomes a promising technology in data center
 interconnections. In flexible grid optical networks, the assignment and
 management of spectrum resources are more flexible, and agile spectrum
 control and management strategies are needed. In this paper, we
 introduce the concept of Spectrum Engineering, which could be used to

  Abstract                 = {{The construction of data center network by applying SDN technology has
 become a hot research topic. The SDN architecture has innovatively
 separated the control plane from the data plane which makes the network
 more software-oriented and agile. Moreover, it provides virtual
 multi-tenancy, effective scheduling resources and centralized control
 strategies to meet the demand for cloud computing data center. However,
 the explosion of network information is facing severe challenges for SDN
 controller. The flow storage and lookup mechanisms based on TCAM device
 have led to the restriction of scalability, high cost and energy
 consumption. In view of this, a source-controlled data center network
 (SCDCN) model is proposed herein. The SCDCN model applies a new type of
 source routing address named the vector address (VA) as the
 packet-switching label. The VA completely defines the communication path
 and the data forwarding process can be finished solely relying on VA.
 There are four advantages in the SCDCN architecture. 1) The model adopts
 hierarchical multi-controllers and abstracts large-scale data center
 network into some small network domains that has solved the restriction
 for the processing ability of single controller and reduced the
 computational complexity. 2) Vector switches (VS) developed in the core
 network no longer apply TCAM for table storage and lookup that has
 significantly cut down the cost and complexity for switches. Meanwhile,
 the problem of scalability can be solved effectively. 3) The SCDCN model
 simplifies the establishment process for new flows and there is no need
 to download flow tables to VS. The amount of control signaling consumed
 when establishing new flows can be significantly decreased. 4) We design
 the VS on the NetFPGA platform. The statistical results show that the
 hardware resource consumption in a VS is about 27\% of that in an OFS.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Agile methods promote iterative development with short cycles, where
 user feedback from the previous iteration is used to refactor and
 improve the current version. To facilitate agile development of
 information systems, this paper offers three contributions. First, we
 introduce the concept of evolvability as a model quality characteristic.
 Evolvability refers to the expected implications of future model
 refactorings, both in terms of complexity of the required database
 evolution algorithm and in terms of the expected volume of data to
 evolve. Second, we propose extending the agile development cycle by
 using database profiling information to suggest adaptations to the
 conceptual model to improve performance. For every software release, the
 database profiler identifies and analyses navigational access patterns,
 and proposes model optimisations based on data characteristics, access
 patterns and a cost-benefit model. Based on an experimental evaluation
 of the profiler we discuss why the quality of conceptual models can
 generally benefit from profiling and how performance measurements convey
 semantic information. Third, we discuss the flow of semantic information
 when developing and using information systems.
 Beyond these contributions, we also make a case for using object
 databases in agile development environments. However, most of the
 presented concepts are also applicable to other database paradigms. (C)

  Abstract                 = {{Process model guidance is an important feature by which the software
 process is orchestrated. Without complying with this guidance, the
 production lifecycle deviates from producing a reliable software with
 high-quality standards. Usually, teams break the process deliberately or
 impulsively. Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) tools log what teams
 do even if they break the process. The log file could be a key to
 discover the behavior of the undertaken process against the targeted
 process model. Since the date of its introduction, Process Mining
 techniques have been used in business process domains with no focus on
 the software engineering processes. This research brings the Process
 Mining techniques to the software engineering domain. The research shows
 a conclusive effort that used a Scrum adapted process model as an
 example of Agile adoption. This research has applied Process Mining
 discovery techniques to capture the actually implemented process by the
 Scrum team. This application clarifies the gap between the standard
 process guidance and the actually implemented one. The research's
 results showed that Process Mining techniques have the ability to
 discover and verify the deviation on both levels; the process itself as
 well as the work items state-machine workflows.}},

  Abstract                 = {{With the blossoming of network functions virtualization and
 software-defined networks, networks are becoming more and more agile
 with features like resilience, programmability, and open interfaces,
 which help operators to launch a network or service with more
 flexibility and shorter time to market. Recently, the concept of network
 slicing has been proposed to facilitate the building of a dedicated and
 customized logical network with virtualized resources. In this article,
 we introduce the concept of hierarchical NSaaS, helping operators to
 offer customized end-to-end cellular networks as a service. Moreover,
 the service orchestration and service level agreement mapping for
 quality assurance are introduced to illustrate the architecture of
 service management across different levels of service models. Finally,
 we illustrate the process of network slicing as a service within
 operators by typical examples. With network slicing as a service, we
 believe that the supporting system will transform itself to a production
 system by merging the operation and business domains, and enabling
 operators to build network slices for vertical industries more agilely.}},

 We extended our previous work with concepts for problem space modeling,
 focusing on reusable knowledge, as well as solution space management,
 focusing on project-level decisions. We implemented these concepts in
 ADMentor, an extension of Sparx Enterprise Architect. ADMentor features
 rapid problem space modeling, UML model linkage,
 question-option-criteria diagram support, meta-information for model
 tailoring, as well as decision backlog management. We validated ADMentor
 by modeling and applying 85 cloud application design decisions and 75
 workflow management decisions, creating one problem and three sample
 solution spaces covering control system architectures, and obtaining
 user feedback on tool and model content.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The diffusion of agile methodologies in software development makes them
 more mature for corporative environment. However, teaching agile
 methodologies on the academic environment poses many difficulties and
 limitations. This paper describes a case study where an innovative
 approach for teaching software development technologies was adopted. In
 this approach, the entire course was designed to fit Scrum's principles,
 so that the students could apply them as they were learning it. Also,
 the course's main project was to be developed in sprints, as proposed in
 Scrum. After almost two years using this approach, in this paper we
 describe our experience and perform a critical analysis. We observed
 some positive points, such as the practical nature of learning by
 example, and a better preparation of the students regarding agile
 methodologies. As negative points, we highlight the impossibility of
 delivering complete products in earlier sprints, and some interaction
 and collaboration difficulties. The main conclusion of this study is
 that, for the approach to work in our academic scenario, a modified
 version of the Scrum methodology was necessary.}},
