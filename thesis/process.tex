This systematic literature review consisted of four separate stages.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Identification of potential sources}
	\item{Filtering of relevant sources}
	\item{Coding}
	\item{Analysis of coding and aggregation}
\end{enumerate}

The data selection process can be split into two differenet phases.
First the selected eletronical databases were searched using predefined
keywords. Then the search results were combined and duplicates were
removed. In the second phase the results were filtered to exclude
irrelevant articles. This filtering was done based on the abstracts
of the articles. Once the primary data sources were identified after
the filtering, data extraction was done by qualitative coding of the
studies. In the final phase these results were analyzed and aggregated.
