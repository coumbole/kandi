Agile software development is a collection of methods describing an
alternative for traditional software developmet methods. The fundamental
idea is to build software iteratively in small increments, while
constantly adapting the software according to customer feedback.
Feedback is acquired by delivering software to the customer already in
the early phases of development. With constant customer involvement
changes can be made rapidly even late in development. These principles were
explained in the ``agile manifesto'' (Beck et al 2001).
