Hui [P7] introduced a new way to lead organizations through agile
transformation called Lean Change. The fundamental idea is to run agile
transformations in a lean manner like startups as described by Ries in
The Lean Startup Methodology [13]. The major idea is to first assess the
situation, then start with a very basic, for example Kanban, workflow
and then introduce changes and adaptions to the process as Minimum
Viable Changes (MVC). These small adjustments can be validated quickly
and incorporate to the workflow if they work and leave out if they do
not. This makes introducing modifications to the process very lean and
lightweight.Â [P7]
