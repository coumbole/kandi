{\bfseries Project management challenges}. Half of the organizations reported
difficulties in project management to be a factor in the decision to initiate
agile transformation [P2, P5, P6]. Some organizations complained about the
increased bureaucratic burdens [P6] and lack of process visibility due to teams
working in isolationÂ [P2]. Wells et al also stated that the lack of visiblity
and communcation led to teams not being able to deliver specified functionality
on time. Agile methods were implemented to emphasize people and communication
over processes [P6].

{\bfseries Schedule and estimation challenges}. Heavy upfront planning had also
made project scheduling and estimation difficult. In most novel projects
customers did not actually know what they wanted, and change requests caused
major complications later in the project. [P6]
