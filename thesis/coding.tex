The nine primary sources were coded using the Atlas.ti qualitative
data analysis software. The coding process followed similar principles
as Dikert et al's systematic literary review of the challenges and
success factors for large-scale agile transformations [5]. Thus,
five of the seven code families used in the aforementioned study
were used in the coding of these studies. The two left out families,
\textit{challenges} and \textit{success factors} were not considered
relevant for this study, since the reserch questions and goals are
different. A description of the code families as well as examples
of certain codes are show in table~\ref{codefamilytable}. The table
also presents the total number of codes and quotations created. A
single quotation may contain several codes and belong to multiple code
families, which is why the total number of quotation is less than the
sum of quotations in each family.
