The six primary sources were coded using the Atlas.ti qualitative data
analysis software. The coding process followed similar principles as
Dikert's, Paasivaara's and Lassenius' systematic literary review of the
challenges and success factors for large-scale agie transformations
[5]. Thus, five of the seven code families used in the aforementioned
study were used in the coding of these studies. A description of
these families as well as examples are show in Table 4. The table
also presents the total number of codes and quotations created. A
single quotation may contain several codes and belong to multiple code
families, which is why the total number of quotation is less than the
sum of quotations in each family.
