All studied organizations reported their initial software development
process to be plan-driven and they referred to the process as waterfall
or traditional process. Most studies did not go very deep when
describing the old process and focused more on the problems and reasons
for the agile transformation rather than the old process description.

Some criticism was present in a few studies. For example, an anonymous
product manager stated: ``\textit{There are very definite stages, almost
monolithic – you have abig design sectino, big development section,
which leads to inefficiencies. Where you find a development problem
becomes a design problem that you have to back all the way to those
different groups... The requirements capture is proved to be inadequate
in traditional methods}''. [P5]
