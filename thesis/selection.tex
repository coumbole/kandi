The study selection process was composed of two phases. In the first
phase, all studies that matched the search queries were filtered by
their abstracts. Furthermore, as the purpose of this paper is to
supplement the findings by Dikert et al [12], all studies that were
already covered by aforementioned researchers were filtered out of
this study. At this point, 49 articles conformed to the list of inclusion
criteria set previously. However, not all abstracts were detailed enough
to prove that the article covered all required aspects. These cases were
included to the full text filtering to make sure all possibly relevant
articles are not left out.

The full text filtering resulted in the additional exclusion of 40
articles that failed to comply to the inclusion criteria. The most
common reason to this was the organization in question not being large
enough as specified in section 2.3. The second most common reason for
exclusion was the failure to provide empirical data of the relevant
topics. Some experience reports that seemed relevant according to the
abstract covered for example solely the results of the transformation
and not the process.
