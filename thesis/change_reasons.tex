This section answers to the research question 1: \textit{Why do large software development organization
initiate agile transformation?}

All organizations in primary studies reported some rationale
for initiating the agile transformation. Reported reasons for
transformations are reported in table~\ref{initreasontable}.

The top reason for transformations was process overhead, followed by
lack of interorganizational collaboration. Traditional waterfall model
for software development is a heavy process, which was taking its toll
on the efficiency of many organizations. Different teams that were
building the same software were not communicating with each other in any
other ways than through the formal documentation that was created during
the software development. This makes accommodating to change very slow
and the whole process becomes very rigid.
