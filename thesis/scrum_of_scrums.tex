Scrum of Scrums is a technique used to scale Scrum practices for organizations
larger than a dozen people. It is not as much of a framework rather than a
method to utilize Scrum in larger environments. The main difference to regular
Scrum is having Ambassadors in each Scrum team that report their respective
teams' daily proceedings in the Scrum of Scrum coordination meetings. The Scrum
of Scrum has their own backlog in which each item contributes to improving
between-team coordination. [15]

Kim described briefly how they adopted Scrum of Scrums to help manage
and support their multisite cross functional teams consisting of
developers, UX designers and QA team (Quality Assurance). In order to operate
efficiently with this new model, they placed external agile coaches to each team
as well as to the Scrum of Scrums team. This was found a valuable contribution,
as the agile training within the organization was taking place simultaneously
with the transformation, so not all members of the teams were proficient with
agile practices. [P4]
