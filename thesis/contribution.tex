This paper contributes to and supplements the findings by Dikert et
al in their unpublished manuscript \textit{Adopting agile software
development in large organizations}. The aforementioned paper was
written between 2013 and 2015, but it was never published. It provided a
valuable contribution to both researchers and practitioners in the field
of large-scale agile software development. However, as the research
data from the paper would be partially outdated by now, a more recent
review of new literature was required. This paper fulfills this need.

For researchers this paper provides an overview of how large software
organizations approach and proceed with agile transformations. Awareness
and understanding of the process and the challenges it presents is a
necessity for further research on the subject. Together with the paper
by Dikert et al this provides an extensive summarization and analysis of
modern large-scale agile transformation.
