This paper contributes to and supplements the findings by Dikert et
al in their unpublished manuscript \textit{Adopting agile software
development in large organizations}. The aforementioned paper was
written between 2013 and 2015, but it was never published. It provided a
valuable contribution to both researchers and practitioners in the field
of large-scale agile software development. However, as the the research
data from the paper would be partially outdated by now, a more recent
review of new literature was required. This paper fulfills this need.

– Elaborate on how this contributed to research or practitioners, or did it?
