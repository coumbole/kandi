Since this study will target specifically large software development
organizations, the definition of large organization will be set to 50
persons or 6 separate teams. This definition is based on Dikert's,
Paasivaara's and Lassenius' research (2016), in which they studied
the success factors and challenges in adopting agile methods in large
organizations. In these organizations all personnel do not need to
be software developers or engineers. The number may include other
positions, such as architects and scrum masters who still participate
in the development process. Another important inclusion criterion for
the organizations is that they must have been using traditional software
development methods in the past, and transitioned to agile methods.
The aim of this study is to study specifically organizations that are
transforming their processes from waterfall to agile, not merely scaling
up agile methods.
