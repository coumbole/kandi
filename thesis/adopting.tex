Agile methods were originally developed for small software development teams.
However, their proved success has made it an attractive alternative for larger
organizations as well. However, it has been noticed that adopting agile methods
in large organizations is more difficult (Dybå and Dingsøyr, 2008). One
significant factor that makes the adoption more challenging that in small
organizations software development teams are typically more independent.
Large software teams have more dependencies between other organizations and
departmens, increasing the need for formal documentation and communication
(Lindvall et al 2004). Agile methods are largely based on quick, informal
communication between team members, such as daily scrums. Once organization and
team sizes grow large enough, informal communication is not sufficient to keep
all stakeholders up to date with the development progress (Lindvall et al 2004,
Cohn \& Ford 2003)
