{\bfseries Lack of collaboration due to organizational silos}. All but
one study reported issues with inter-organizational communication. Ayed
et al reported that \textit{``business stakeholders do not collaborate
enough with technical team members''} [P2]. Roman et al stated the
lack of collaboration to be one of the most significant reasons for
the transformation: \textit{``The transformation to agile also aims
to reduce the communication gaps between business and IT''} [P4]. Kim
et al reported that Samsung Electronics organized ``cross-functional
teams to reduce the silo effect from component based team model''. It
was found that in most projects it is not enough that the business
stakeholders deliver a list of required functionality and the technical
team implements them. In reality, the whole design and implementation
project requires constant collaboration. [P2, P6]

{\bfseries Lack of customer collaboration}. Missing customer
collaboration was also reported as a significant factor in replacing
waterfall development. Weak customer engagement resulted in poor
customer experience [P2, P6]. Roman et al stated the long feedback
loops and delivery times to play an important role in initiating the
transformation.
