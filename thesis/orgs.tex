{\bfseries Organization sizes}. The size of the ten studied
organizations varied from 50 to several thousand engineers. Not all
papers explicitly reported the exact size of their software development
organization, but the size could be concluded as large. This was the
case with for example Ericsson [P3], Samsung electronics [P4] and the
anonymous company referred to as ``ORG'' by Roman et al [P5].

{\bfseries Business areas}. Business areas ranged from public IT
organization [P2] to telecom [P3, P6] and online services for consumers
and businesses [P1, P4, P5]. The last mentioned area includes software
as a service solutions for businesses, customized software delivery for
businesses and online services for both consumers and businesses.
