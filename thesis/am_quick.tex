Another adoption methodology that one of the organizations in the
primary studies had utilized was AM-QuICK (Agile Methods Quality
Integrated Customisation framework) [14, P2]. This framework is designed to
support the adopters throughout the transformation process by defining
``Situational Method Engineering'' techniques. The framework relies on
constant measurement conducted during the transformation process. This
information is then used to orient the adopters towards the specific
processes that require correction. [14]
